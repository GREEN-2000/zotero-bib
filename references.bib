  abstract = {The poultry sector is facing infections from Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria and Staphylococcus spp., and Escherichia coli, that have developed multidrug resistance aptitude. Antibiotics cause disturbances in the balance of normal microbiota leading to dysbiosis, immunosuppression, and the development of secondary infections. Bacteriophages have been reported to lower the colonization of Salmonella and Campylobacter in poultry. The specificity of bacteriophages is greater than that of antibiotics and can be used as a cocktail for enhanced antibacterial activity. Specie-specific phages have been prepared, e.g., Staphylophage (used against Staphylococcus bacteria) that specifically eliminate bacterial pathogens. Bacteriophage products, e.g., BacWashTM and Ecolicide PX have been developed as antiseptics and disinfectants for effective biosecurity and biosafety measures. The success of phage therapy is influenced by time to use, the amount used, the delivery mechanism, and combination therapy with other therapeutics. It is a need of time to build a comprehensive understanding of the use of bacteriophages in poultry production. The current review thus focuses on mechanisms of bacteriophages against poultry pathogens, their applications in various therapeutics, impacts on the economy, and current challenges.},

Their pathogenicity together with the widespread of these bacteria, contributes to many economic losses and poses a threat to public health. With the increasing prevalence of bacterial pathogens being resistant to most conventional antibiotics, scientists have rekindled interest in using bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents. Bacteriophage treatments have also been investigated as an alternative to antibiotics in the poultry industry. Bacteriophages’ high specificity may allow them only to target a specific bacterial pathogen in the infected animal. However, a tailor-made sophisticated cocktail of different bacteriophages could broaden their antibacterial activity in typical situations with multiple clinical strains infections. Bacteriophages may not only be used in terms of reducing bacterial contamination in animals but also, under industrial conditions, they can be used as safe disinfectants to reduce contamination on food-contact surfaces or poultry carcasses. Nevertheless, bacteriophage therapies have not been developed sufficiently for widespread use. Problems with resistance, safety, specificity, and long-term stability must be addressed in particular. This review highlights the benefits, challenges, and current limitations of bacteriophage applications in the poultry industry.},

  abstract = {In this commentary I consider use of the term “lysis from without” (LO) along with the phenomenon's biological relevance. LO originally described an early bacterial lysis induced by high-multiplicity virion adsorption and that occurs without phage production (here indicated as LOV). Notably, this is more than just high phage multiplicities of adsorption leading to bacterial killing. The action on bacteria of exogenously supplied phage lysin, too, has been described as a form of LO (here, LOL). LOV has been somewhat worked out mechanistically for T4 phages, has been used to elucidate various phage-associated phenomena including discovery of the phage eclipse, may be relevant to phage ecology, and, with resistance to LO (LOR), is blocked by certain phage gene products. Speculation as to the impact of LOV on phage therapy also is fairly common. Since LOV assays are relatively easily performed and not all phages are able to induce LOV, a phage's potential to lyse bacteria without first infecting should be subject to at least in vitro experimental confirmation before the LOV label is applied. The term “abortive infection” may be used more generally to describe non-productive phage infections that kill bacteria.},

Due to their efficient mechanisms for lethal membrane disruption, these proteins are gaining interest in many fields, including the medical, food, biotechnological, and pharmaceutical fields. However, investigating these lethal proteins is challenging due to their toxicity in bacterial expression systems and the resultant low protein yields have hindered their analysis compared to other cell lytic proteins. Therefore, the structural and dynamic properties of holins and spanins in their native environment are not well-understood. In this article we describe recent advances in the classification, purification, and analysis of holin and spanin proteins, which are beginning to overcome the technical barriers to understanding these lethal membrane disrupting proteins, and through this, unlock many potential biotechnological applications.},

Blood samples were withdrawn from 7 selected chicks in each treatment at 7, 21,~28, 35 and 42 days of age, and analyzed for total protein, albumin and globulin concentration, and the~albumin: globulin ratio computed. Glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutatamate~pyruvate transaminase (GPT) levels in serum were measured on days 7 and 42.Results: The results revealed that albumin (p \&lt; 0.001), globulin (p \&lt; 0.001) and albumin: globulin ratio~(p \&lt; 0.001) were influenced by the time of blood collection. Globulin increased significantly after ST~challenge while albumin decreased significantly. Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) after ST~challenge was affected by treatment (p \&lt; 0.05). Higher levels were obtained from birds which had~received NEOX or positive control, compared to negative control group.Conclusion: Salmonella challenge affects serum albumin, globulin and GOT enzyme. The results~obtained suggest that the probiotic, Toyocerin, mitigates the negative effects of Salmonella challenge.Keywords: Bacillus subtilis PB6, Bacillus Cereus var. toyoi, Probiotics, Liver enzymes, Hematology,~Salmonella enterica},

  abstract = {Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica is traditionally subdivided into serovars by serological and nutritional characteristics. We used Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) to assign 4,257 isolates from 554 serovars to 1092 sequence types (STs). The majority of the isolates and many STs were grouped into 138 genetically closely related clusters called eBurstGroups (eBGs). Many eBGs correspond to a serovar, for example most Typhimurium are in eBG1 and most Enteritidis are in eBG4, but many eBGs contained more than one serovar. Furthermore, most serovars were polyphyletic and are distributed across multiple unrelated eBGs. Thus, serovar designations confounded genetically unrelated isolates and failed to recognize natural evolutionary groupings. An inability of serotyping to correctly group isolates was most apparent for Paratyphi B and its variant Java. Most Paratyphi B were included within a sub-cluster of STs belonging to eBG5, which also encompasses a separate sub-cluster of Java STs. However, diphasic Java variants were also found in two other eBGs and monophasic Java variants were in four other eBGs or STs, one of which is in subspecies salamae and a second of which includes isolates assigned to Enteritidis, Dublin and monophasic Paratyphi B. Similarly, Choleraesuis was found in eBG6 and is closely related to Paratyphi C, which is in eBG20. However, Choleraesuis var. Decatur consists of isolates from seven other, unrelated eBGs or STs. The serological assignment of these Decatur isolates to Choleraesuis likely reflects lateral gene transfer of flagellar genes between unrelated bacteria plus purifying selection. By confounding multiple evolutionary groups, serotyping can be misleading about the disease potential of S. enterica. Unlike serotyping, MLST recognizes evolutionary groupings and we recommend that Salmonella classification by serotyping should be replaced by MLST or its equivalents.},

A study was conducted to evaluate the role of BP against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) on SE internal organs colonization and ileum immune response in laying hens. Hens were challenged both orally and intracloacally with 108 cfu/mL cells of nalidixic acid resistant Salmonella Enteritidis (SENAR). Thirty-two Single Comb White Leghorns were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments: 1) unchallenged control (negative control; T1), 2) SENAR challenged control (positive control; T2), 3) SENAR challenged + 0.1\% BP (T3), and 4) SENAR challenged + 0.2\% BP (T4). The number of SENAR in the ceca was significantly reduced by 0.2\% BP supplementation (P {$<$} 0.05) at 7 d post infection (dpi). The respective number of SENAR was reduced from 2.9 log cfu/gm in T2 and T3 to 2.0 log cfu/gm in T4. There was no significant effect of T3 on reduction of numbers of cecal SENAR. A significant reduction of SENAR was observed in the liver with gall bladder (LGB) from 0.75 in T2 to 0.18 log cfu/gm in T4. In the spleen, T4 significantly reduced (P {$<$} 0.05) SENAR to 0.56 log cfu/gm compared to T2 and T3 (0.94 log cfu/gm). There was no significant effect of T3 in reduction of prevalence of spleen SENAR. By supplementing 0.2\% BP (T4), the SENAR in the ovary was reduced to 0 log cfu/gm. There was a significant reduction (P {$<$} 0.05) in fecal SENAR at 6 dpi by T4 (0.71 log cfu/gm) compared to the positive control (1.57 log cfu/gm). The expression of interferon (IFN)-Γ, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 was significantly increased in the ileum by SENAR challenge compared to the negative control. This study suggests that apart from commonly used prebiotics or probiotics, BP are pathogen-specific and can be used as one of the dietary strategies to reduce SE colonization and induce immune modulation in laying hens.},

Spray-drying conditions, including inlet air temperature, air flow rate and feed pump, were fixed as independent variables, while probiotic survival, moisture content, water activity and effective yield were established as dependent variables. The survival of encapsulated L. rhamnosus by spray drying was optimized with response surface methodology, and the stability of the powder was assessed. The optimum spray-drying conditions were an inlet air temperature, air flow rate and feed pump rate of 169?°C, 33?m3/h and 16?mL/h, respectively, survival of 70\%, air aspiration of 84\% and outlet air temperature of 52?°C, achieving an overall desirability of 0.96.

The results indicated that a protein-trehalose-maltodextrin mixture is a good wall material to encapsulate L. rhamnosus, showing important thermal protection during the drying process and increasing survival. However, a decrease in this capacity is observed at an air outlet temperature of approximately 101?°C. The possible effects of the wall materials and the drying conditions on survival are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Bacterial biofilms have recently gained considerable interest in the food production and medical industries due to their ability to resist destruction by disinfectants and other antimicrobials. Biofilms are extracellular polymer matrices that may enhance the survival of pathogens even when exposed to environmental stress. The effect of incubation temperatures (25°C, 37°C, and 40°C) and Salmonella serotype on biofilm-forming potentials was evaluated. Previously typed Salmonella serotypes (55) isolated from the gut of chickens were accessed for biofilms formation using a standard assay. Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028TM and Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 13076TM (positive controls), Escherichia coli (internal control) and un-inoculated Luria Bertani (LB) broth (negative control) were used. The isolates formed no biofilm (11.86–13.56\%), weak (11.86–45.76\%), moderate (18.64–20.34\%), strong biofilms (23.73–54.24\%) across the various temperatures investigated. Serotypes, Salmonella Heidelberg and Salmonella Weltevreden were the strongest biofilm formers at temperatures (25°C, 37°C, and 40°C, respectively). The potential of a large proportion (80\%) of Salmonella serotypes to form biofilms increased with increasing incubation temperatures but decreased at 40°C. Findings indicate that average temperature favours biofilm formation by Salmonella serotypes. However, the influence of incubation temperature on biofilm formation was greater when compared to serotype. A positive correlation exists between Salmonella biofilm formed at 25°C, 37°C and 40°C (p ≥ 0.01). The ability of Salmonella species to form biofilms at 25°C and 37°C suggests that these serotypes may present severe challenges to food-processing and hospital facilities.},

As a result of several discussions between international groups working in the area of biofilms, we present a guideline for the spectrophotometric and fluorometric assessment of biofilm formation in microplates. This guideline has been divided into 5 main sections, each presenting a comprehensive set of recommendations.

Colistin is presently considered the last line of defense against human infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms such as carbapenemase-producer Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter baumanni, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Transferable bacterial resistance like mcr-genes was reported in isolates from both humans and animals. Researchers actively seek strategies to reduce colistin resistance. The definition of guidelines for colistin therapy in veterinary and human medicine is thus crucial. The ban of colistin use in swine as a growth promoter and for prophylactic purposes, and the implementation of sustainable measures in farm animals for the prevention of infections, would help to avoid resistance and should be encouraged. Colistin resistance in the human–animal–environment interface stresses the relevance of the One Health approach to achieve its effective control. Such measures should be addressed in a cooperative way, with efforts from multiple disciplines and with consensus among doctors, veterinary surgeons, and environment professionals. A revision of the mechanism of colistin action, resistance, animal and human use, as well as colistin susceptibility evaluation is debated here.},

Two Cor species of \textasciitilde 13 and \textasciitilde 8.5~kDa, corresponding to the preprolipoprotein/prolipoprotein and lipoprotein, were observed by Western blot. Cell mutants for CorC17F, CorA18D and CorA57E lost the Sie phenotype for FhuA-dependent phages. A copurification affinity binding assay combined with LC\_ESI\_MS/MS showed that Cor bound to OMPs: OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, OmpW, LamB, and Slp. Interestingly, Sie for FhuA-dependent phages was reduced on Cor overexpressing FhuA+ mutant strains, where ompA, ompC, ompF, ompW, lamB, fhuE, genes were knocked out. The exclusion was restored when these strains were supplemented with plasmids expressing these genes. Sie was not lost in other Cor overexpressing FhuA+ null mutant strains JW3938(btuB-), JW5100(tolB-), JW3474(slp-).

  abstract = {Microbial food spoilage and foodborne disease are the main challenges in the food industry regarding food shelf life. Current preservation methods are frequently associated with changes in organoleptic characteristics and loss of nutrients. For this reason, bacteriophage offers an alternative natural method as a biocontrol agent that can reduce bacterial contamination in food without altering the organoleptic properties. This study was conducted to isolate and characterize bacteriophage from soil to control food spoilage bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis, and foodborne pathogenic bacteria, such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Isolation was done by agar overlay assay method, and phages BC-S1, BS-S2, ETEC-S3, and EHEC-S4 were recovered. The host range of all isolated phages tended to be narrow and had high specificity towards the specific bacteria. The phage efficiency were measured where ETEC-S3 showed no effectivity against B. cereus and EHEC-S4 showed low efficiency against Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). Morphology analysis was conducted for phage BC-S1 and ETEC-S3 with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and it is shown to belong to the Caudovirales order. Phages BC-S1 and BS-S2 significantly reduced the host bacteria when applied to the cooked rice and pasteurized milk samples with miMOI of 0.1. While phage ETEC-S3 at miMOI of 0.001 and phage EHEC-S4 at miMOI of 1 also showed a significant reduction when applied to chicken meat and lettuce samples at storage temperatures of 4~°C and 28~°C. The highest bacterial reduction of 100\% was shown by phage BC-S1 on pasteurized milk samples and reduction up to 96.06\% by phage ETEC-S3 on chicken meat samples at 28~°C incubation.},

  abstract = {Acute enteric infections caused by salmonellas remain a major public health burden worldwide. Poultry, particularly chickens, are known to be the main reservoir for this zoonotic pathogen. Although some progress has been made in reducing Salmonella colonization of broiler chickens by using biosecurity and antimicrobials, it still remains a considerable problem. The use of host-specific bacteriophages as a biocontrol is one possible intervention by which Salmonella colonization could be reduced. A total of 232 Salmonella bacteriophages were isolated from poultry farms, abattoirs, and wastewater in 2004 and 2005. Three phages exhibiting the broadest host ranges against Salmonella enterica serotypes Enteritidis, Hadar, and Typhimurium were characterized further by determining their morphology and lytic activity in vitro. These phages were then administered in antacid suspension to birds experimentally colonized with specific Salmonella host strains. The first phage reduced S. enterica serotype Enteritidis cecal colonization by ≥4.2 log10 CFU within 24 h compared with controls. Administration of the second phage reduced S. enterica serotype Typhimurium by ≥2.19 log10 CFU within 24 h. The third bacteriophage was ineffective at reducing S. enterica serotype Hadar colonization. Bacteriophage resistance occurred at a frequency commensurate with the titer of phage being administered, with larger phage titers resulting in a greater proportion of resistant salmonellas. The selection of appropriate bacteriophages and optimization of both the timing and method of phage delivery are key factors in the successful phage-mediated control of salmonellas in broiler chickens.},

  abstract = {The E34 phage is a member of the podoviridae family of phages, (short non-contractile tailed bacteriophages) that uses Salmonella newington as its host. This phage initiates the infection of its host via a specific interaction between its tailspike protein (TSP) and the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the bacterial. The E34 TSP is structurally similar and functionally equivalent to the P22 phage whose TSP has been well characterized and electron micrographs of both phages appear indistinguishable. The crystal structure of P22 phage TSP in complex with the O-antigen of S. typhimurium has been determined; and the active site of the TSP demonstrated to be the residues Asp392, Asp395 and Glu359 of the receptor binding domain. In another phage called E15, a phylogenetic relative of E34 phage, a short polysaccharide consisting of α repeating units is responsible for the interaction between the E15 phage and Salmonella anatum’s LPS leading to the adsorption of the phage to the bacteria. Studies on E34 phage shows that it interacts with Salmonella newington’s O antigen polysaccharide component of the LPS, this polysaccharide consists of mannosyl-rhamnosyl-galactose repeating units joined together by β-galactosyl linkages. However, no data exist regarding the specific residues of E34 TSP that are responsible for LPS binding and hydrolysis. In this study, the tailspike gene was cloned onto vector pET30a-LIC and expressed as a fusion protein termed the extended E34 TSP (EE34 TSP). We characterized the protein based on resistance to heat, SDS, and proteases; showing that the protein is heat resistant, shows aberrant electrophoretic mobility in the presence of SDS gradient, and actively binds to P22 phage heads to form hybrid phages that cannot infect P22 host. We also demonstrate via in silico study that the E34 TSP binds to and hydrolyses the O-antigen of its host via the ALA250, SER279 and ASP280 residues. Finally, testing E34 phage ability to protect Vero cells from Salmonella infection shows highly encouraging results, implying that E34 phage can be used in therapeutic/preventive medicine.},

This study was conducted to characterize and employ a single bacteriophage as a potential biocontrol agent. Phage Rostam was isolated, characterized and then applied as biocontrol agent against S. enteritidis in liquid whole eggs and eggshell. Rostam is a novel myovirus belonging to the Rosemountvirus genus and active against Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. Rostam is stable in a pH range from 4 to 10, a salt concentration of 1–9~\%, whereas UV radiation gradually reduces phage stability, and its 53~kb genome sequence indicates this phage does not contain known toxins or lysogeny-associated genes. Its latent period is short with a burst size of 151 PFU/cell, under standard growth conditions. Killing curves indicate that at higher multiplicities of infection (MOI), the reduction in S. enteritidis count is more pronounced. Phage Rostam (MOI 10,000) reduces S. enteritidis growth to below the detection limit at 4~°C in both liquid whole eggs and on the eggshell within 24~h. Due to its high lytic activity and stability in relevant conditions, Rostam has the potential to be an efficient biopreservative for egg and egg products.},

  abstract = {Biofilm formation occurs spontaneously on both inert and living systems and is an important bacterial survival strategy. In humans biofilms are responsible for many pathologies, most of them associated with the use of medical devices. A major problem of biofilms is their inherent tolerance to host defences and antibiotic therapies; there is therefore an urgent need to develop alternative ways to prevent and control biofilm-associated clinical infections. Several in vitro experiments have shown that phages are able to infect biofilm cells and that those phages inducing the production of depolymerases have an advantage since they can penetrate the inner layers of the biofilm by degrading components of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix. In practice clinically relevant biofilms and especially those associated with the use of medical devices can possibly be controlled for example by the topic application or the impregnation of the surface of the device with a phage solution. Another interesting approach has been the use of a phage encoding a phage polysaccharide lyase to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in cystic fibrosis patients by aerosol administration. All these strategies require prior identification of the phage and/or polysaccharide depolymerase capable of infecting the bacterial cells and degrading the polysaccharide within the biofilm, respectively. The biofilm organisms must therefore be isolated and screened against a bank of phages. This procedure is essential and raises important biotechnological challenges: the existence of a bank of phages well characterised (physiologically and genetically) whose efficacy in vivo has been tested and pharmacokinetics studied; the existence of economical and safe production protocols and purification methods (e.g. the presence of endotoxins in a phage preparation may compromise phage therapy). It is however important to consider the fact that the chances of getting a specific phage with a high lytic capability and preferential expressing a relevant exopolymer degrading enzyme is likely to be low. Genetically engineered phages can play an important role in this process. Phages can be genetically manipulated to alter their host range and to induce the production of depolymerases. It is therefore important to reinforce the application of synthetic biology to engineer phages able to efficiently degrade medical biofilms. It is also important to develop efficient methods of phage delivery and to study "in vivo" the phage performance against biofilms. It is still not clear how effective the biofilm can be in protecting the phages against the immune system. Efficient and economic phage production and purification protocols need also to be addressed before one can hope to use phage treatment to prevent or control infectious biofilms.},

  abstract = {Phages have highly compact genomes with sizes reflecting their capacity to exploit the host resources. Here, we investigate the reasons for tRNAs being the only translation-associated genes frequently found in phages. We were able to unravel the selective processes shaping the tRNA distribution in phages by analyzing their genomes and those of their hosts. We found ample evidence against tRNAs being selected to facilitate phage integration in the prokaryotic chromosomes. Conversely, there is a significant association between tRNA distribution and codon usage. We support this observation by introducing a master equation model, where tRNAs are randomly gained from their hosts and then lost either neutrally or according to a set of different selection mechanisms. Those tRNAs present in phages tend to correspond to codons that are simultaneously highly used by the phage genes, while rare in the host genome. Accordingly, we propose that a selective recruitment of tRNAs compensates for the compositional differences between the phage and the host genomes. To further understand the importance of these results in phage biology, we analyzed the differences between temperate and virulent phages. Virulent phages contain more tRNAs than temperate ones, higher codon usage biases, and more important compositional differences with respect to the host genome. These differences are thus in perfect agreement with the results of our master equation model and further suggest that tRNA acquisition may contribute to higher virulence. Thus, even though phages use most of the cell’s translation machinery, they can complement it with their own genetic information to attain higher fitness. These results suggest that similar selection pressures may act upon other cellular essential genes that are being found in the recently uncovered large viruses.},

  abstract = {Salmonella spp. is a relevant foodborne pathogen with worldwide distribution. To mitigate Salmonella infections, bacteriophages represent an alternative to antimicrobials and chemicals in food animals and food in general. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria, which interact constantly with their host. Importantly, the study of these interactions is crucial for the use of phages as a mitigation strategy. In this study, experimental coevolution of Salmonella Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) and a lytic phage was conducted in tryptic soy broth for 21 days. Transfer to fresh media was conducted daily and every 24 hours, 2 mL of the sample was collected to quantify Salmonella OD600 and phage titter. Additionally, time-shift experiments were conducted on 20 colonies selected on days 1, 12, and 21 to evaluate the evolution of resistance to past (day 1), present (day 12), and future (day 21) phage populations. The behavior of the dynamics was modeled and simulated with mathematical mass-action models. Bacteria and phage from days 1 and 21 were sequenced to determine the emergence of mutations. We found that S. Enteritidis grew for 21 days in the presence and absence of the phage and developed resistance to the phage from day 1. Also, the phage was also able to survive in the media for 21 days, however, the phage titer decreased in approx. 3 logs PFU/mL. The stability of the lytic phage population was consistent with the leaky resistance model. The time-shift experiments showed resistance to phages from day 1 of at least 85\% to the past, present, and future phages. Sequencing of S. Enteritidis showed mutations in genes involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes rfbP and rfbN at day 21. The phage showed mutations in the tail phage proteins responsible for recognizing the cell surface receptors. These results suggest that interactions between bacteria and phage in a rich resource media generate a rapid resistance to the infective phage but a fraction of the population remains susceptible. Interactions between Salmonella and lytic phages are an important component for the rational use of phages to control this important foodborne pathogen.},

A virulent strain studied in detail spread through the body faster, persisted for a longer period and was more invasive than an avirulent strain. In the system studied invasiveness was the virulence determinant of overriding importance.},

The molecular docking and MD simulation results identified critical amino acids (ASP47, ASP56, ARG71, and Gly74) of CHAPk domain responsible for its catalytic activity. Chimeric endolysin CHAPk-SH3bk showed an effective binding to peptidoglycan fragment using 14 hydrogen bonds. The in-vitro antibacterial assays displayed higher activity of CHAPk against planktonic MRSA with 2-log10 reduction in 2~h. Both CHAPk and CHAPk-SH3bk displayed bactericidal activity against MRSA with ∼4log10 and ∼3.5log10 reduction in 24~h. Biofilm reduction activity displayed CHAPk-SH3bk reduced 33~\% and 60~\% of hospital-associated ATCC®BAA-44™ and bovine origin SA1 respectively. The CHAPk treatment reduced 47~\% of the preformed biofilm formed by bovine-origin MRSA SA1. This study indicates an effective reduction of preformed MRSA biofilms of human and animal origin using novel chimeric construct CHAPk-SH3bk.

  abstract = {Recent cases of emergent diseases have renewed interest in the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that promote parasite adaptation to novel hosts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Crucial to adaptation is the degree of mixing of original, susceptible hosts, and novel hosts. An increase in the frequency of the original host has two opposing effects on adaptation: an increase in the supply of mutant pathogens with improved performance on the novel host 7, 8, 9; and reduced selection to infect novel hosts, caused by fitness costs commonly observed to be associated with host switching 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. The probability of disease emergence will therefore peak at intermediate frequencies of the original host. We tested these predictions by following the evolution of a virus grown under a range of different frequencies of susceptible (original) and resistant (novel) host bacteria. Viruses that evolved to infect resistant hosts were only detected when susceptible hosts were at frequencies between 0.1\% and 1\%. Subsequent experiments supported the predictions that there was reduced selection and mutation supply at higher and lower frequencies, respectively. These results suggest that adaptation to novel hosts can occur only under very specific ecological conditions, and that small changes in contact rates between host species might help to mitigate disease emergence.},

  abstract = {Viruses play critical roles in the dynamics of microbial communities. Lytic viruses, for example, kill significant fractions of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes daily. The dynamic interplay between viruses and microbes results from an overlap of physiological, ecological, and evolutionary responses: environmental changes trigger host physiological changes, affecting the ecological interactions of host and virus and, ultimately, the evolutionary pressures influencing the two populations. Recent theoretical work studied how the dependence of viral traits on host physiology (viral plasticity) affects the evolutionarily stable host cell size and viral infection time emerging from coevolution. Here, we broaden the scope of the framework to consider any coevolutionary outcome, including potential evolutionary collapses of the system. We used the case study of Escherichia coli and T-like viruses under chemostat conditions, but the framework can be adapted to any microbe-virus system. Oligotrophic conditions led to smaller, lower-quality but more abundant hosts, and infections that were longer but produced a reduced viral offspring. Conversely, eutrophic conditions resulted in fewer but larger higher-quality hosts, and shorter but more productive infections. The virus influenced host evolution decreasing host size more noticeably for low than for high dilution rates, and for high than for low nutrient input concentration. For low dilution rates, the emergent infection time minimized host need/use, but higher dilution led to an opportunistic strategy that shortened the duration of infections. System collapses driven by evolution resulted from host failure to adapt quickly enough to the evolving virus. Our results contribute to understanding the eco-evolutionary dynamics of microbes and virus, and to improving the predictability of current models for host-virus interactions. The large quantitative and qualitative differences observed with respect to a classic description (in which viral traits are assumed to be constant) highlights the importance of including viral plasticity in theories describing short- and long-term host-virus dynamics.},

Here we introduce the Phage On Tap (PoT) protocol for the quick and efficient preparation of homogenous bacteriophage (phage) stocks. This method produces homogenous, laboratory-scale, high titer (up to 1010–11 PFU·ml−1), endotoxin reduced phage banks that can be used to eliminate the variability between phage propagations and improve the molecular characterizations of phage. The method consists of five major parts, including phage propagation, phage clean up by 0.22 μm filtering and chloroform treatment, phage concentration by ultrafiltration, endotoxin removal, and the preparation and storage of phage banks for continuous laboratory use. From a starting liquid lysate of {$>$} 100 mL, the PoT protocol generated a clean, homogenous, laboratory phage bank with a phage recovery efficiency of 85\% within just two days. In contrast, the traditional method took upwards of five days to produce a high titer, but lower volume phage stock with a recovery efficiency of only 4\%. Phage banks can be further purified for the removal of bacterial endotoxins, reducing endotoxin concentrations by over 3,000-fold while maintaining phage titer. The PoT protocol focused on T-like phages, but is broadly applicable to a variety of phages that can be propagated to sufficient titer, producing homogenous, high titer phage banks that are applicable for molecular and cellular assays.},

Chickens were euthanatized at day 20 of age for individual SE detection, quantitative bacteriology, and phage isolation from the intestine and from a pool of organs. SE detection was performed by both bacteriologic culture and genome detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Qualitative bacteriology showed that aerosol-spray delivery of BPs significantly reduced the incidence of SE infection in the chicken group (P = 0.0084) to 72.7\% as compared with the control group (100\%). In addition, SE counts showed that phage delivery both by coarse spray and drinking water reduced the intestinal SE colonization (P {$<$} 0.01; P {$<$} 0.05, respectively). BPs were isolated at 10 days postinfection from the intestine and from pools of organs from BP-treated chickens.

  abstract = {The Ff filamentous bacteriophages show potential as a new class of therapeutics, displaying utility in materials science as well as pharmaceutical applications. These phages are produced by the infection of E. coli, a Gram-negative bacterium which unavoidably sheds endotoxins into the extracellular space during growth. Since endotoxin molecules are highly immunoreactive, separation from the phage product is of critical importance, particularly those developed for human therapeutic use. The properties of M13, one of the Ff group, present a purification challenge chiefly because the standard scalable method for endotoxin removal from proteins-anion exchange chromatography-is not applicable due to pI similarity between the particles. This article examines the potential of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-NaCl precipitation as a scalable method for the separation of endotoxins from phage M13. Precipitation of M13 by 2\% (w/v) PEG 6 000, 500 mM NaCl reduced endotoxin contamination of the phage product by 88\%, but additional precipitation rounds did not maintain this proportional decrease. Dynamic light scattering was subsequently used to determine the effectiveness of a detergent to disassociate endotoxin molecules from M13. As a result, PEG-NaCl precipitation was supplemented with up to 2\% (v/v) Triton X-100 to improve separation. A 5.7 log10 reduction in endotoxin concentration was achieved over three rounds of precipitation whilst retaining over 97\% of the phage. This method compares favorably with the well-known ATPS (Triton X-114) technique for endotoxin removal from protein solutions.},

The purpose of this study was to gain a clearer understanding of the reactivity of these viral particles when they come into contact with bacteria embedded in biofilms. Experimentally, we quantified lactococcal c2 phage diffusion and reaction through model biofilms using in situ fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with two-photon excitation. Correlation curves for fluorescently labeled c2 phage in nonreacting Stenotrophomonas maltophilia biofilms indicated that extracellular polymeric substances did not provide significant resistance to phage penetration and diffusion, even though penetration and diffusion were sometimes restricted because of the noncontractile tail of the viral particle. Fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity of the labeled phage were detected throughout the thickness of biofilms formed by c2-sensitive and c2-resistant strains of Lactococcus lactis but could never be correlated with time, revealing that the phage was immobile. This finding confirmed that recognition binding receptors for the viral particles were present on the resistant bacterial cell wall. Taken together, our results suggest that biofilms may act as “active” phage reservoirs that can entrap and amplify viral particles and protect them from harsh environments.},

Here, we apply paired metaproteomics and dsDNA-targeted metagenomics to identify 1,875 virion-associated proteins from the ocean. Over one-half of these proteins were newly functionally annotated and represent abundant and widespread viral metagenome-derived protein clusters (PCs). One primarily unannotated PC dominated the dataset, but structural modeling and genomic context identified this PC as a previously unidentified capsid protein from multiple uncultivated tailed virus families. Furthermore, four of the five most abundant PCs in the metaproteome represent capsid proteins containing the HK97-like protein fold previously found in many viruses that infect all three domains of life. The dominance of these proteins within our dataset, as well as their global distribution throughout the world’s oceans and seas, supports prior hypotheses that this HK97-like protein fold is the most abundant biological structure on Earth. Together, these culture-independent analyses improve virion-associated protein annotations, facilitate the investigation of proteins within natural viral communities, and offer a high-throughput means of illuminating functional viral dark matter.},

  abstract = {Prophages can alter their bacterial hosts to prevent other phages from infecting the same cell, a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE). Such alterations are facilitated by phage interactions with critical bacterial components involved in motility, adhesion, biofilm production, conjugation, antimicrobial resistance, and immune evasion. Therefore, the impact of SIE extends beyond the immediate defense against superinfection, influencing the overall fitness and virulence of the bacteria. Evaluating the interactions between phages and their bacterial targets is critical for leading phage therapy candidates like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for persistent and antibiotic-resistant opportunistic infections. However, comprehensive literature on the mechanisms underlying SIE remains scarce. Here, we provide a compilation of well-characterized and potential mechanisms employed by Pseudomonas phages to establish SIE. We hypothesize that the fitness costs imposed by SIE affect bacterial virulence, highlighting the potential role of this mechanism in the management of bacterial infections.},

  abstract = {Bacteria growing on surfaces appear to be profoundly more resistant to control by lytic bacteriophages than do the same cells grown in liquid. Here, we use simulation models to investigate whether spatial structure per se can account for this increased cell density in the presence of phages. A measure is derived for comparing cell densities between growth in spatially structured environments versus well mixed environments (known as mass action). Maintenance of sensitive cells requires some form of phage death; we invoke death mechanisms that are spatially fixed, as if produced by cells. Spatially structured phage death provides cells with a means of protection that can boost cell densities an order of magnitude above that attained under mass action, although the effect is sometimes in the opposite direction. Phage and bacteria self organize into separate refuges, and spatial structure operates so that the phage progeny from a single burst do not have independent fates (as they do with mass action). Phage incur a high loss when invading protected areas that have high cell densities, resulting in greater protection for the cells. By the same metric, mass action dynamics either show no sustained bacterial elevation or oscillate between states of low and high cell densities and an elevated average. The elevated cell densities observed in models with spatial structure do not approach the empirically observed increased density of cells in structured environments with phages (which can be many orders of magnitude), so the empirical phenomenon likely requires additional mechanisms than those analyzed here.},

Here we unveil a distinct type of CRISPR–Cas Inhibition strategy that is based on small non-coding RNA anti-CRISPRs (Racrs). Racrs mimic the repeats found in CRISPR arrays and are encoded in viral genomes as solitary repeat units4. We show that a prophage-encoded Racr strongly inhibits the type I-F CRISPR–Cas system by interacting specifically with Cas6f and Cas7f, resulting in the formation of an aberrant Cas subcomplex. We identified Racr candidates for almost all CRISPR–Cas types encoded by a diverse range of viruses and plasmids, often in the genetic context of other anti-CRISPR genes5. Functional testing of nine candidates spanning the two CRISPR–Cas classes confirmed their strong immune inhibitory function. Our results demonstrate that molecular mimicry of CRISPR repeats is a widespread anti-CRISPR strategy, which~opens~the door to potential biotechnological applications6.},

As research moves toward understanding complex phage populations, purification needs have shifted to maximize the amount of phage while maintaining diversity and activity. The effects of standard phage purification procedures such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradients on both diversity and activity of a phage population are not known. We have examined the effects of PEG precipitation and CsCl density gradients on a number of known phage (M13, T4, and ΦX 174) of varying structure and size, individually and as mixed sample. Measurement of phage numbers and activity throughout the purification process was performed. We demonstrate that these methods, used routinely to generate “pure” phage samples, are in fact detrimental to retention of phage number and activity; even more so in mixed phage samples. As such, minimal amounts of processing are recommended to introduce less bias and maintain more of a phage population.},

Additionally, pneumococci recovered from human infections are characterized by a high prevalence of lysogenic bacteriophages (phages) residing quiescently in their host chromosome. We investigated a possible link between lysogeny and biofilm formation. Considering that extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a key factor in the biofilm matrix, we reasoned that prophage spontaneous activation with the consequent bacterial host lysis could provide a source of eDNA, enhancing pneumococcal biofilm development. Monitoring biofilm growth of lysogenic and non-lysogenic pneumococcal strains indicated that phage-infected bacteria are more proficient at forming biofilms, that is their biofilms are characterized by a higher biomass and cell viability. The presence of phage particles throughout the lysogenic strains biofilm development implicated prophage spontaneous induction in this effect. Analysis of lysogens deficient for phage lysin and the bacterial major autolysin revealed that the absence of either lytic activity impaired biofilm development and the addition of DNA restored the ability of mutant strains to form robust biofilms. These findings establish that limited phage-mediated host lysis of a fraction of the bacterial population, due to spontaneous phage induction, constitutes an important source of eDNA for the S. pneumoniae biofilm matrix and that this localized release of eDNA favors biofilm formation by the remaining bacterial population.},

Bacteriophages (phages) are naturally occurring predators of bacteria with high specificity and also the capacity to evolve to overcome bacterial resistance. Therefore phage therapy is a promising alternative to antibiotics in animal production. This study tested the efficacy of a phage cocktail composed of three phages for the control of poultry infected with C. coli and C. jejuni. Moreover, it evaluated the effectiveness of two routes of phage administration (by oral gavage and in feed) in order to provide additional information regarding their future use in a poultry unit.},

The bacterial cells within the biofilm are embedded within the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) consisting mainly of exopolysaccharides, secreted proteins, lipids, and extracellular DNA. This structural matrix poses a major challenge against common treatment options due to its extensive antibiotic-resistant properties. Because biofilms are so recalcitrant to antibiotics, they pose a unique challenge to patients in a nosocomial setting, mainly linked to lower respiratory, urinary tract, and surgical wound infections as well as the medical devices used during treatment. Another unique property of biofilm is its ability to adhere to both biological and man-made surfaces, allowing growth on human tissues and organs, hospital tools, and medical devices, etc. Based on prior understanding of bacteriophage structure, mechanisms, and its effects on bacteria eradication, leading research has been conducted on the effects of phages and its individual proteins on biofilm and its role in overall biofilm removal while also revealing the obstacles this form of treatment currently have. The expansion in the phage host-species range is one that urges for improvement and is the focus for future studies. This review aims to demonstrate the advantages and challenges of bacteriophage and its components on biofilm removal, as well as potential usage of phage cocktail, combination therapy, and genetically modified phages in a clinical setting.},

However, DNA-based analysis cannot reliably discriminate between signals from viable and dead bacteria. We developed a strategy based on an SE qPCR assay that can be integrated into system testing to accelerate the detection of viable SE in egg-enriched cultures and verify the yielded SE isolates. The specificity of the assay was evaluated against 89 Salmonella strains, and SE was accurately identified in every instance. To define the indicator for a viable bacteria readout, viable or heat-inactivated SE were spiked into shell egg contents to generate post-enriched, artificially contaminated cultures to establish the quantification cycle (Cq) for viable SE. Our study has demonstrated that this technique could potentially be applied to accurately identify viable SE during the screening stage of naturally contaminated shell eggs following enrichment to provide an early alert, and that it consistently identified the serotypes of SE isolates in a shorter time than conventional testing.},

Recent studies using lytic bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections (phage therapy) demonstrate that phages can promote susceptibility to chemical antibiotics and that phage/antibiotic synergy is possible. However, both lytic and lysogenic bacteriophages can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. In particular, some phages mediate the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria via transduction and other mechanisms. In addition, chronic infection filamentous phages can promote antimicrobial tolerance, the ability of bacteria to persist in the face of antibiotics. In particular, filamentous phages serve as structural elements in bacterial biofilms and prevent the penetration of antibiotics. Over time, these contributions to antibiotic tolerance favor the selection of resistance clones. Here, we review recent insights into bacteriophage contributions to antibiotic susceptibility, resistance, and tolerance. We discuss the mechanisms involved in these effects and address their impact on bacterial fitness.},

This view stems from studies in the 1990s to the first decade of the twenty-first century that revealed high viral abundance, high viral diversity and virus-induced microbial death in aquatic ecosystems as well as an association between collapses in bacterial density and peaks in phage abundance. The recent surge in metagenomic analyses has provided deeper insight into the abundance, genomic diversity and spatio-t emporal dynamics of phages in a wide variety of ecosystems, ranging from deep oceans to soil and the mammalian digestive tract. However, the causes and consequences of variations in phage community compositions remain poorly understood. In this Review, we explore current knowledge of the composition and evolution of phage communities, as well as their roles in controlling the population and evolutionary dynamics of bacterial communities. We discuss the need for greater ecological realism in laboratory studies to capture the complexity of microbial communities that thrive in natural environments.},

  abstract = {CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) mimicking the function of microbial CpG-dideoxynucleotides containing DNA (CpG-DNA) are potent immune stimuli. The immunostimulatory activity and the species-specific activities of a CpG-ODN depend on its nucleotide sequence properties, including CpG-hexamer motif types, spacing between motifs, nucleotide sequence, and length. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 is the cellular receptor for CpG-ODNs in mammalian species, while TLR21 is the receptor in avian species. Mammalian cells lack TLR21, and avian cells lack TLR9; however, both TLRs are expressed in fish cells. While nucleotide sequence properties required for a CpG-ODN to strongly activate mammalian TLR9 and its species-specific activities to different mammalian TLR9s are better studied, CpG-ODN activation of TLR21 is not yet well investigated. Here we characterized chicken and duck TLR21s and investigated their activation by CpG-ODNs. Chicken and duck TLR21s contain 972 and 976 amino acid residues, respectively, and differ from TLR9s as they do not have an undefined region in their ectodomain. Cell-based TLR21 activation assays were established to investigate TLR21 activation by different CpG-ODNs. Unlike grouper TLR21, which was preferentially activated by CpG-ODN with a GTCGTT hexamer motif, chicken and duck TLR21s do not distinguish among different CpG-hexamer motifs. Additionally, these two poultry TLR21s were activated by CpG-ODNs with lengths ranging from 15 to 31 nucleotides and with different spacing between CpG-hexamer motifs. These suggested that compared to mammalian TLR9 and grouper TLR21, chicken and duck TLR21s have a broad CpG-ODN sequence recognition profile. Thus, they could also recognize a wide array of DNA-associated molecular patterns from microbes. Moreover, CpG-ODNs are being investigated as antimicrobial agents and as vaccine adjuvants for different species. This study revealed that there are more optimized CpG-ODNs that can be used in poultry farming as anti-infection agents compared to CpG-ODN choices available for other species.},

  abstract = {The microbiome of the broiler chicken gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has been extensively studied, and it has been amply demonstrated that it plays an important role in the health of the host, as it has a positive impact on the immune system, the physiology of the GIT, and productivity. Also, the microbiota is involved in reducing and preventing colonization by enteric pathogens through the process of competitive exclusion and the production of bacteriostatic and bactericidal substances. The taxonomic composition of the microbiota is affected by different factors, such as the organ, the age of the animal, diet and the use of antimicrobials., Different kinds of additives that regulate the microbial community in feed include probiotics (live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host), prebiotics (ingredients that stimulate increased beneficial microbial activity in the digestive system in order to improve the health of the host) and phytobiotics (primary or secondary components of plants that contain bioactive compounds that exert a positive effect on the growth and health of animals). Phages may potentially provide an integrated solution to modulate the intestinal microbiome of chicken intestines, as they reduce specific pathogenic microbial populations, permitting the proliferation of beneficial microbiota. Studies have shown that the use of cocktails of phages, especially in high concentrations and with short lapses of time between exposure to the bacteria and treatment with phages, optimize the reduction of Salmonella in chickens. Each of these technologies has demonstrable positive effects on the health of the host and the reduction of the pathogen load in controlled assays., This paper presents a comprehensive summary of the role of the microbiota in the broiler chicken gastrointestinal tract, and discusses the usefulness of different strategies for its modulation to control pathogens, with a particular emphasis on bacteriophages.},

  abstract = {The microbiota in broiler chicken intestines affects the animals’ health, metabolism, and immunity both positively and negatively. Accordingly, it has a significant impact on animal productivity. Phages, host-specific parasites of bacterial cells, are a promising antimicrobial alternative that selectively target pathogens without disturbing the microbiota. The purpose of this study is to further characterize the commensal microbial community at production scale in broiler chickens treated with a Salmonella phage treatment. We evaluated the cecal microbiota of broilers reared in a commercial farming system where a phage cocktail against Salmonella, SalmoFree was supplied to animals. To do so, two field trials were conducted, incorporating three doses of phages in the broilers’ drinking water. Our results showed that the core microbiome (taxa that were present in more than 50\% of samples) contained species that are key to microbiota adaptation in the last stage of the production cycle. Among these, there are some important degraders of complex polysaccharides and producers of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as Eisenbergiella and Lachnoclostridium. The phage cocktail did not affect the normal development of the microbiota’s structure. The addition of the phage cocktail resulted in a significant reduction in Campylobacter and an increase in Butyricimonas, Helicobacter and Rikenellaceae, which are common inhabitants in chicken gut with known negative and positive effects on their health and metabolism. Altogether, we consider that these results contribute valuable information to the implementation of large-scale phage therapy technologies.},

Poultry products are thought to be the main source of Salmonella, which means that it is necessary to control Salmonella at the pre-harvest stage. Bacteriophages, acting as host-specific parasites of bacterial cells, represent one of the alternatives to antibiotics that can contribute to food safety and security. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of the bacteriophage cocktail SalmoFREE® to control Salmonella on a commercial broiler farm. We assessed the relationship between the use of SalmoFREE® and productivity parameters (feed conversion, weight gain, homogeneity). Two field trials (trial 1 n = 34,986; trial 2 n = 34,680) were carried out under commercial rearing conditions on a Colombian broiler farm with a record of Salmonella presence. Each trial comprised 2 control chicken houses and 2 experimental ones. SalmoFREE® and a control suspension were delivered in the drinking water at 3 time points in the production cycle, and the presence of Salmonella was assessed in cloacal swabs the day before and after the treatments. Results revealed that SalmoFREE® controls the incidence of Salmonella and does not affect the animals nor the production parameters, demonstrating its efficacy and innocuity at the production scale. We detected phage-specific genes in samples of total DNA extracted from ceca after the treatment with SalmoFREE®, and tested for the appearance of cocktail-resistant Salmonella, which showed to be an uncommon event. These results contribute relevant information to the adoption of phage therapy as an alternative to growth-promoter antibiotics on poultry farms.},

A bacteriophage is a virus which infects a bacterium. Archaea are also infected by viruses, whether these should be referred to as ‘phages’ is debatable, but they are included as such in the scope this article. Phages have been of interest to scientists as tools to understand fundamental molecular biology, as vectors of horizontal gene transfer and drivers of bacterial evolution, as sources of diagnostic and genetic tools and as novel therapeutic agents. Unraveling the biology of phages and their relationship with their hosts is key to understanding microbial systems and their exploitation. In this article we describe the roles of phages in different host systems and show how modeling, microscopy, isolation, genomic and metagenomic based approaches have come together to provide unparalleled insights into these small but vital constituents of the microbial world.},

  abstract = {Although the multiplication of bacteriophages (phages) has a substantial impact on the biosphere, comparatively little is known about how the external environment affects phage production. Here we report that sub-lethal concentrations of certain antibiotics can substantially stimulate the host bacterial cell's production of some virulent phage. For example, a low dosage of cefotaxime, a cephalosporin, increased an uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain's production of the phage ΦMFP by more than 7-fold. We name this phenomenon Phage-Antibiotic Synergy (PAS). A related effect was observed in diverse host-phage systems, including the T4-like phages, with β-lactam and quinolone antibiotics, as well as mitomycin C. A common characteristic of these antibiotics is that they inhibit bacterial cell division and trigger the SOS system. We therefore examined the PAS effect within the context of the bacterial SOS and filamentation responses. We found that the PAS effect appears SOS-independent and is primarily a consequence of cellular filamentation; it is mimicked by cells that constitutively filament. The fact that completely unrelated phages manifest this phenomenon suggests that it confers an important and general advantage to the phages.},

In any niche, the diversity of phage is directly proportional to the associated discriminating bacterial population as a host. Pathogens including MDR bacteria in wastewater are responsible for big outbreaks in many developing nations and the biggest emerging threat to public health. Every effort leading to reduction of pathogens in the environment has to be promoted and implemented for establishing a healthy and sustainable environment. The inefficient functioning of STPs is the significant reservoir of diverse bacterial population, including MDR. A biocontrol capability through phage has been demonstrated in the control of pathogens in food industry, medicine, aquaculture and agriculture and could be implemented to environment. In order to apply phage formulation in the environment, it must be a wild type and should be well characterised; that includes genome annotation, validation of genes of obligate lytic cycle and without the virulence factors. The implementation will demand long-term trials with microbial community. This can be ensured through advances in metagenomics, which will monitor shifts in the community structure after phage interventions. Phages would emerge as eco-friendly biocontrol agents and could be considered as an obvious alternative to chemical disinfectant and preservatives.},

  abstract = {As the global burden of disease caused by multidrug resistant bacteria is a major source of concern, credible clinical alternatives to antibiotic therapy, such as personalized phage therapy, are actively explored. Although phage therapy has been used for more than a century, the issue of an easy to implement diagnostic tool for determining phage susceptibility that meets current routine clinical needs is still open. In this Review, we summarize the existing methods used for determining phage activity on bacteria, including the three reference methods: the spot test, the double agar overlay plaque assay, and the Appelmans method. The first two methods rely on the principle of challenging the overnight growth of a lawn of bacteria in an agar matrix to a known relative phage to bacteria concentration and represent good screening tools to determine if the tested phage can be used for a “passive” and or “active” treatment. Beside these methods, several techniques, based on “real-time” growth kinetics assays (GKA) have been developed or are under development. They all monitor the growth of clinical isolates in the presence of phages, but use various detection methods, from classical optical density to more sophisticated techniques such as computer-assisted imagery, flow-cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or metabolic indicators. Practical considerations as well as information provided about phage activity are reviewed for each technique. Finally, we also discuss the analytical and interpretative requirements for the implementation of a phage susceptibility testing tool in routine clinical microbiology.},

  abstract = {The phage PRR1 belongs to the Leviviridae family, a group of ssRNA bacteriophages that infect Gram-negative bacteria. The variety of host cells is determined by the specificity of PRR1 to a pilus encoded by a broad host range of IncP-type plasmids that confer multiple types of antibiotic resistance to the host. Using P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 as a host, we analyzed the PRR1 infection cycle, focusing on cell lysis. PRR1 infection renders P. aeruginosa cells sensitive to lysozyme approximately 20 min before the start of a drop in suspension turbidity. At the same time, infected cells start to accumulate lipophilic anions. The on-line monitoring of the entire infection cycle showed that single-gene-mediated lysis strongly depends on the host cells’ physiological state. The blockage of respiration or a reduction in the intracellular ATP concentration during the infection resulted in the inhibition of lysis. The same effect was observed when the synthesis of PRR1 lysis protein was induced in an E. coli expression system. In addition, lysis was strongly dependent on the level of aeration. Dissolved oxygen concentrations sufficient to support cell growth did not ensure efficient lysis, and a coupling between cell lysis initiation and aeration level was observed. However, the duration of the drop in suspension turbidity did not depend on the level of aeration.},

Bacteriophages have provided many examples of satellite nucleic acids that utilize their helper morphogenic genes for propagation.

The satellites in these systems encode for encapsidation machinery but have an absence of key replication genes, thus providing the first example of bacteriophage satellite viruses. We also show that codon usage of the satellites matches the tRNA gene content of the helpers. The satellite in one of these systems, Flayer, does not appear to integrate into the host genome, which represents the first example of a virulent satellite phage. The Flayer satellite has a unique tail adaptation that allows it to attach to its helper for simultaneous co-infection. These findings demonstrate an ever-increasing array of satellite strategies for genetic dependence on their helpers in the evolutionary arms race between satellite and helper phages.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, viruses infecting bacteria, recognize their host with high specificity, binding to either saccharide motifs or proteins of the cell wall of their host. In the majority of bacteriophages, this host recognition is performed by receptor binding proteins (RBPs) located at the extremity of a tail. Interaction between the RBPs and the host is the trigger for bacteriophage infection, but the molecular details of the mechanisms are unknown for most bacteriophages. Here, we present the electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of bacteriophage T5 RBPpb5 in complex with its Escherichia coli receptor, the iron ferrichrome transporter FhuA. Monomeric RBPpb5 is located at the extremity of T5’s long flexible tail, and its irreversible binding to FhuA commits T5 to infection. Analysis of the structure of RBPpb5 within the complex, comparison with its AlphaFold2-predicted structure, and its fit into a previously determined map of the T5 tail tip in complex with FhuA allow us to propose a mechanism of transmission of the RBPpb5 receptor binding to the straight fiber, initiating the cascade of events that commits T5 to DNA ejection., IMPORTANCE Tailed bacteriophages specifically recognize their bacterial host by interaction of their receptor binding protein(s) (RBPs) with saccharides and/or proteins located at the surface of their prey. This crucial interaction commits the virus to infection, but the molecular details of this mechanism are unknown for the majority of bacteriophages. We determined the structure of bacteriophage T5 RBPpb5 in complex with its E. coli receptor, FhuA, by cryo-EM. This first structure of an RBP bound to its protein receptor allowed us to propose a mechanism of transmission of host recognition to the rest of the phage, ultimately opening the capsid and perforating the cell wall and, thus, allowing safe channeling of the DNA into the host cytoplasm.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria coexist in the oceans with a wealth of phages that infect them. While numerous studies have investigated Synechococcus phages, much less data are available for Prochlorococcus phages. Furthermore, little is known about cyanophage composition. Here, we examined the abundance and relative composition of cyanophages on six cyanobacterial hosts in samples collected during spring and summer from the Red Sea. Maximal abundances found on Synechococcus of 35 000 phages/ml are within ranges found previously, whereas the 24 000 phages/ml found on Prochlorococcus are approximately 10-fold higher than previous findings. T7-like, T4-like and ‘unknown’ phages were isolated on all hosts, including many T4-like phages on high-light adapted Prochlorococcus strains, whereas TIM5-like phages were found only on Synechococcus. Large differences in cyanophage abundance and composition were found for different hosts on the same sampling date, as well as for the same host on different dates, with few predictable patterns discerned. Host range analyses showed that T7-like and TIM5-like phages were quite host-specific, whereas the breadth of hosts for T4-like phages was related to host type: those isolated on high-light adapted Prochlorococcus were considerably more host-specific than those on low-light adapted Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus. These host-related differences likely contribute to the complexity of host–phage interactions in the oceans.},

Therefore, seeking alternatives to AGP is crucial for animal husbandry. Among all AGP alternatives, probiotics are promising candidates. In this study, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, L. johnsonii 3-1 and L. crispatus 7-4, were isolated from the feces of wild Gallus gallus, which exhibited obvious anti-pathogenic activity and improved the growth performance of broilers. Furthermore, we found that these two strains participated in the lipid metabolism of broilers by reducing the content of TC and TG in ileal epithelial cells and up-regulating the liver AMPKα/PPARα/CPT-1 pathway, which affects abdominal fat deposition. In summary, L. johnsonii 3-1 and L. crispatus 7-4 have the potential to be used as AGP substitutes and participate in the lipid metabolism of broilers to reduce abdominal fat deposition. Importantly, our study reveals for the first time that L. crispatus participates in liver lipid metabolism to reduce abdominal fat deposition in broilers.},

Yet, despite the remarkable diversity of phages at the nucleotide sequence level, the structural proteins that form viral particles show strong similarities and conservation. Phages are uniquely interconnected from an evolutionary perspective and undergo multiple events of genetic exchange in response to the selective pressure of their hosts, which drives their diversity.

A total of 85 mice were inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 strain Ec231 [nalidixic acid resistant (NalAcR)] via oral gavage, and were randomized into six groups separated into three categories: 1st category received PBS or No phage/No PBS (control), 2nd category received either F.O.P., F.O.P. at 1:10 dilution, or only the E. coli phage component of F.O.P. (EcoShield PXTM), and 3rd category received the antibiotic ampicillin. All therapies were administered twice daily for four consecutive days including before and after bacterial challenge; except ampicillin which was administered only before and after bacterial challenge on day 0. Fecal samples were collected at Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. Samples were homogenized and plated on LB plates supplemented with NalAc to determine viable Ec231 counts. Body weights were measured at every fecal sample collection point. qPCR was performed using specific E. coli O157:H7 primers to quantify the number of E. coli O157:H7 genome copies. Microbiota community profiles were analyzed using Denature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA sequencing. F.O.P. significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) reduced E. coli O157:H7 pathogen counts by 54\%. Ampicillin therapy significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) reduced E. coli O157:H7 pathogen counts by 79\%. Greater initial weightloss occurred in mice treated with ampicillin (−5.44\%) compared to other treatment groups. No notable changes in the gut microbiota profiles were observed for control and F.O.P. groups. In contrast, the antibiotic group displayed noticeable distortion of the gut microbiota composition, only partially returning to normal by Day 10. In conclusion, we found that F.O.P. administration was effective in reducing viable E. coli O157:H7 in infected mice with a similar efficacy to ampicillin therapy. However, the F.O.P. bacteriophage preparation had less impact on the gut microbiota compared to ampicillin.},

  abstract = {ConspectusIn the two decades since mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) was first applied to visualize the distribution of peptides across biological tissues and cells, the technique has become increasingly effective and reliable. MSI excels at providing complementary information to existing methods for molecular analysis—such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics—and stands apart from other chemical imaging modalities through its capability to generate information that is simultaneously multiplexed and chemically specific. Today a diverse family of MSI approaches are applied throughout the scientific community to study the distribution of proteins, peptides, and small-molecule metabolites across many biological models.The inherent strengths of MSI make the technique valuable for studying microbial systems. Many microbes reside in surface-attached multicellular and multispecies communities, such as biofilms and motile colonies, where they work together to harness surrounding nutrients, fend off hostile organisms, and shield one another from adverse environmental conditions. These processes, as well as many others essential for microbial survival, are mediated through the production and utilization of a diverse assortment of chemicals. Although bacterial cells are generally only a few microns in diameter, the ecologies they influence can encompass entire ecosystems, and the chemical changes that they bring about can occur over time scales ranging from milliseconds to decades. Because of their incredible complexity, our understanding of and influence over microbial systems requires detailed scientific evaluations that yield both chemical and spatial information. MSI is well-positioned to fulfill these requirements. With small adaptations to existing methods, the technique can be applied to study a wide variety of chemical interactions, including those that occur inside single-species microbial communities, between cohabitating microbes, and between microbes and their hosts.In recognition of this potential for scientific advancement, researchers have adapted MSI methodologies for the specific needs of the microbiology research community. As a result, workflows exist for imaging microbial systems with many of the common MSI ionization methods. Despite this progress, there is substantial room for improvements in instrumentation, sample preparation, and data interpretation. This Account provides a brief overview of the state of technology in microbial MSI, illuminates selected applications that demonstrate the potential of the technique, and highlights a series of development challenges that are needed to move the field forward. In the coming years, as microbial MSI becomes easier to use and more universally applicable, the technique will evolve into a fundamental tool widely applied throughout many divisions of science, medicine, and industry.},

  abstract = {Objective Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in epithelial permeability. Design A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. Results The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD. Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by TNFα and interferon γ (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. Conclusions Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.},

Gallinarum B/00111, intended to be used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: other zootechnical additives) for all avian species. The additive (tradename Bafasal®) is not currently authorised in the European Union. Bafasal® is intended to be used in water for drinking and liquid complementary feed to guarantee a minimum daily dose of 2 × 106 PFU/bird, to reduce the Salmonella spp. contamination of poultry carcasses and load in the environment, and to improve the zootechnical performance of the treated animals. In a previous opinion, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the additive's potential to be irritant or a dermal sensitiser, or on its efficacy for any avian species due to insufficient data. The applicant provided supplementary information to address these data gaps. The new data showed that Bafasal® is not a skin or eye irritant. No conclusions could be drawn on its skin sensitisation potential. The Panel was not in the position to conclude on the efficacy of Bafasal® to improve the zootechnical performance of the target species based on the available data. The additive showed the potential to decrease the counts of two strains of Salmonella Enteritidis in boots swabs and caecal digesta of chickens for fattening. No conclusions could be drawn on the capacity of Bafasal® to reduce the contamination of other Salmonella enterica strains, serovars or other species of Salmonella. The potential of Bafasal® to reduce the Salmonella spp. contamination poultry carcasses and/or the environment is limited. The FEEDAP Panel recommended a post-market monitoring plan to address the potential selection and spread of resistant variants of Salmonella to Bafasal®.},

Bacteriophages are now being reconsidered as therapeutic agents against bacterial infections due the emergence of multidrug resistance. However, bacteriophage resistance through defense systems and other means could hinder the development of successful phage-based therapies. Here, we review the current state of the field of bacteriophage defense, highlight the relevance of bacteriophage defense for potential clinical use of bacteriophages as therapeutic agents and suggest new directions of research.},

  abstract = {Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is considered a severe issue to both poultry business and health of the general public. In that context, 50 samples from 250 diseased broiler chickens in 10 chicken farms were employed to Escherichia coli isolation. Microbiological techniques were employed to detect isolates of E. coli from 250 diseased broiler chickens which were examined by antimicrobial susceptibility profiles against 11 antimicrobial agents using disc diffusion technique as well as their biofilm forming capacity were detected. In addition to, study the isolation and purification of phages based on spot technique to verify that lytic phages are present in E. coli isolates and plaque assay for titration of bacteriophages. In the present research, we also looked at the ability of bacteriophages to inhibit and dissolve previously formed biofilms by E. coli O78 isolate. Moreover, experimental testing of E. coli O78 bacteriophages for colibacillosis prevention and control in one day old broiler chicks were done. The obtained results showed that twenty-six E. coli isolates out of 50 examined samples were isolated (10.4\%). The most prevalent serotypes were O78, O121:H7, O146:H2, O124, O113:H4, O112:H2, O1:H7, O55:H7, O2:H6, O91:H21, O26:H11. Antibiogram results demonstrated the resistance of E. coli isolates with high percentage 100\% were against, Ampicillin, Amoxicillin and Tetracycline. Biofilm quantification analysis showed that 24/26 (92.3\%) isolates were considered biofilm producer isolates. The characterization and the lytic activity of bacteriophage were performed based on Transmission electron microscopy and showed the greatest lytic activity against the evaluated host strains with effective activity at concentration of 107 at 24 h and strong significant reduction of the established E. coli O 78 biofilm within 12 h. The result of experimental infection showed that the performance indicators of phage in treated and challenged group showed high significant increase in body weight, weight gain and improved FCR than infected –antibiotic treated and infected bacteriophage and antibiotic treated. Total viable cell counts of E. coli in the lungs of birds revealed that there is highly significant difference between the six groups count results. We concluded that phage therapy found to be an attractive option to prevent and control multidrug resistant colibacillosis in broilers.},

  abstract = {Host adapted Salmonella strains are responsible for a number of disease manifestations in mammals, including an asymptomatic chronic infection where bacteria survive within macrophages located in systemic sites. However, the host cell physiology and metabolic requirements supporting bacterial persistence are poorly understood. In a mouse model of long-term infection, we found that S. typhimurium preferentially associates with anti-inflammatory/M2 macrophages at later stages of infection. Further, PPARδ, a eukaryotic transcription factor involved in sustaining fatty acid metabolism, is up-regulated in Salmonella-infected macrophages. PPARδ deficiency dramatically inhibits Salmonella replication, which is linked to the metabolic state of macrophages and the level of intracellular glucose available to bacteria. Pharmacological activation of PPARδ increases glucose availability and enhances bacterial replication in macrophages and mice, while Salmonella fail to persist in Pparδ-null mice. These data suggest that M2 macrophages represent a unique niche for the long-term intracellular bacterial survival and link the PPARδ-regulated metabolic state of the host cell to persistent bacterial infection.},

Bacteriophages that are specific to the bacterial species and destroy bacteria can be effectively used for treatment. In this study, we characterized lytic bacteriophages specific to A. baumannii strains. We isolated lytic bacteriophages from environmental water samples and then investigated their morphology, host range, growth characteristics, stability, genome analysis, and biofilm destruction on the catheter surface. Our results showed that the efficacy of the phages varied between 32\% and 78\%, tested on 78 isolates of A. baumannii; 80 phages were isolated, and two lytic bacteriophages, vB\_AbaP\_HB01 (henceforth called C2 phage) and vB\_AbaM\_HB02 (henceforth called K3 phage), were selected for characterization. Electron microscopy scans revealed that the C2 and K3 phages were members of the Podoviridae and Myoviridae families, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the sequence of the C2 phage is available in the NCBI database (accession number: OP917929.1), and it was found sequence identity with Acinetobacter phage AB1 18\%, the K3 phage DNA sequence is closely related to Acinetobacter phage vB\_AbaM\_phiAbaA1 (94\% similarity). The cocktail of C2 and K3 phages demonstrated a promising decrease in the bacterial cell counts of the biofilm after 4 h. Under a scanning electron microscope, the cocktail treatment destructed the biofilm on the catheter. We propose that the phage cocktail could be a strong alternative to antibiotics to control the A. baumannii biofilm in catheter infections.},

The first and second most commonly reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The European Union (EU) trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable during 2014–2018. The proportion of human salmonellosis cases due to Salmonella Enteritidis was at the same level in 2018 as in 2017. Of the 27 reporting MS, 16 met all Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, whereas 11 MS failed meeting at least one. The EU flock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys decreased during recent years but stalled in breeding turkeys. Salmonella results from Competent Authorities for pig carcasses and for poultry tested through National Control Programmes were more frequently positive compared with food business operators. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections in humans were the third most commonly reported zoonosis in the EU and increased from 2014 to 2018. Yersiniosis was the fourth most frequently reported zoonosis in humans in 2018 with a stable trend in 2014–2018. The number of reported confirmed listeriosis cases further increased in 2018, despite Listeria rarely exceeding the EU food safety limit tested in ready-to-eat food. In total, 5,146 food- and waterborne outbreaks were reported. Salmonella was the most commonly detected agent with S. Enteritidis causing one in five outbreaks. Salmonella in eggs and egg products was the highest risk agent/food pair. A large increase of human West Nile virus infections was reported in 2018. The report further updates on bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.},

  abstract = {Salmonella contamination is a critical problem in poultry farms, with serious consequences for both animals and food products. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of phage cocktails to reduce Salmonella contamination in poultry farms. Within the scope of the study, Salmonella phages were isolated from chicken stool. After the host range of phages was determined, morphological characterization was performed through transmission electron microscopy analysis. Then, replication parameters and adsorption rates were determined by one-step growth curves. After that, phage cocktail was prepared, and its effectiveness was tested in three environments, which were drinking water, shavings, and plastic surfaces. The results obtained have demonstrated that the phage cocktail can reduce Salmonella count up to 2.80 ­log10 units in drinking water, up to 2.30 ­log10 units on shavings, and 2.31 ­log10 units on plastic surfaces. It has been determined that phage cocktails could be a successful alternative in reducing Salmonella contamination in poultry environment. This work is the first study to investigate the use of phage cocktails for reducing Salmonella contamination in poultry water and on shavings, and it is presumed that the results obtained will contribute to the fight against pathogens by making them applicable to poultry farms.},

However, there is a new situation in poultry disease where it is necessary to study feed additives, which can overcome the diseases that were previously controlled through the addition of antibiotics and antimicrobial growth promoters in the feed. Therefore, trehalose was investigated to determine whether it impacts the growth performance and pathogenic bacteria (C. jejuni and C. perfringens) inoculation in broilers. In the first experiment, the tolerance of broilers to the addition of trehalose to their feed was investigated. There was no significant difference (p {$>$} 0.05) in body weight changes, daily weight gain, feed intake or feed conversion ratio during the feeding period. Within a 35-day feeding period, it was concluded that a trehalose dosage up to 10\% does not exert a negative effect on broiler farming. Moreover, there was no significant difference (p {$>$} 0.05) in the broilers’ growth performance, as well as C. jejuni and C. perfringens counts in the intestines and feces of broilers observed over a 5-week feeding period. However, Lactobacillus counts significantly increased in these groups with 3\% and 5\% trehalose supplementation. The findings indicate that trehalose supplementation in the feed cannot directly decrease C. jejuni and C. perfringens counts but may enhance gut health by raising Lactobacillus counts in chicken gut, particularly when enteropathogenic bacteria are present.},

  abstract = {When using bacteriophages to control food-borne bacteria in food production plants and processed food, it is crucial to consider that environmental conditions influence their stability. These conditions can also affect the physiological state of bacteria and consequently host–virus interaction and the effectiveness of the phage ability to reduce bacteria numbers. In this study we investigated the stability, binding, and replication capability of phage P100 and its efficacy to control Listeria monocytogenes under conditions typically encountered in dairy plants. The influences of SDS, Lutensol AO 7, salt, smear water, and different temperatures were investigated. Results indicate that phage P100 is stable and able to bind to the host under most conditions tested. Replication was dependent upon the growth of L. monocytogenes and efficacy was higher when bacterial growth was reduced by certain environmental conditions. In long-term experiments at different temperatures phages were initially able to reduce bacteria up to seven log10 units after 2 weeks at 4°C. However, thereafter, re-growth and development of phage-resistant L. monocytogenes isolates were encountered.},

Among such therapies, the use of bacteriophages (phages) as antimicrobial agents, namely, phage therapy, is a promising treatment strategy supported by the findings of recent successful compassionate treatments in Europe and the United States. In this work, we combined host range and genomic information to design a 6-phage cocktail killing several clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including those collected from Italian cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and analyzed the cocktail performance. We demonstrated that the cocktail composed of four novel phages (PYO2, DEV, E215 and E217) and two previously characterized phages (PAK\_P1 and PAK\_P4) was able to lyse P. aeruginosa both in planktonic liquid cultures and in biofilms. In addition, we showed that the phage cocktail could cure acute respiratory infection in mice and treat bacteremia in wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larvae. Furthermore, administration of the cocktail to larvae prior to bacterial infection provided prophylaxis. In this regard, the efficiency of the phage cocktail was found to be unaffected by the MDR or mucoid phenotype of the pseudomonal strain. The cocktail was found to be superior to the individual phages in destroying biofilms and providing a faster treatment in mice. We also found the Galleria larva model to be cost-effective for testing the susceptibility of clinical strains to phages, suggesting that it could be implemented in the frame of developing personalized phage therapies.},

We aimed to investigate a phenomenon of intergeneric recombination and its trajectories across the natural populations of phages predominantly linked to foodborne pathogens. The results from the recombination analyses, using a large array of the recombination detection algorithms imbedded in SplitsTree, RDP4, and Simplot software packages, provided strong evidence (fit: 100; P\,\,≤\,0.014) for both bi- and multi-directional intergeneric recombination of the genetic loci involved collectively in phage morphogenesis, host specificity, virulence, replication, and persistence. Intergeneric recombination was determined to occur not only among conspecifics of the virulent versus temperate phages but also between the phages with these different lifestyles. The recombining polyvalent phages were suggested to interact with fairly large host species networks, including sometimes genetically very distinct species, such as e.g., Salmonella enterica and/or Escherichia coli versus Staphylococcus aureus or Yersinia pestis. Further studies are needed to understand whether phage-driven intergeneric recombination can lead to undesirable changes of intestinal and other microbiota in humans and animals.},

  abstract = {Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) has been the major cause of the food-borne salmonellosis pandemic in humans over the last 20 years, during which contaminated hen’s eggs were the most important vehicle of the infection. Eggs can be contaminated on the outer shell surface and internally. Internal contamination can be the result of penetration through the eggshell or by direct contamination of egg contents before oviposition, originating from infection of the reproductive organs. Once inside the egg, the bacteria need to cope with antimicrobial factors in the albumen and vitelline membrane before migration to the yolk can occur. It would seem that serotype Enteritidis has intrinsic characteristics that allow an epidemiological association with hen eggs that are still undefined. There are indications that SE survives the attacks with the help of antimicrobial molecules during the formation of the egg in the hen’s oviduct and inside the egg. This appears to require a unique combination of genes encoding for improved cell wall protection and repairing cellular and molecular damage, among others.},

  abstract = {Human infections with Salmonella Enteritidis are often attributed to the consumption of contaminated eggs, so the prevalence of this pathogen in egg-laying poultry is an important public health risk factor. Numerous and complex environmental influences on Salmonella persistence and transmission are exerted by management practices and housing facilities used in commercial egg production. In recent years, the animal welfare implications of poultry housing systems have guided the development of alternatives to traditional cage-based housing, but their food safety consequences are not yet fully understood. The present study assessed the effects of different bird stocking densities on the frequency and duration of fecal shedding of S. Enteritidis in groups of experimentally infected laying hens housed in colony cages enriched with perching and nesting areas. In two trials, groups of laying hens were distributed at two stocking densities (648 and 973\,cm2/bird) into enriched colony cages and (along with a group housed in conventional cages at 648\,cm2/bird) orally inoculated with doses of 1.0\,×\,108 cfu of S. Enteritidis. At 10 weekly postinoculation intervals, samples of voided feces were collected from beneath each cage and cultured to detect S. Enteritidis. Fecal shedding of S. Enteritidis was detected for up to 10\,weeks postinoculation by hens in all three housing treatment groups. The overall frequency of positive fecal cultures was significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.05) greater from conventional cages than from enriched colony cages (at the lower stocking density) for the total of all sampling dates (45.0 vs. 33.3\%) and also for samples collected at 4–9\,weeks postinfection. Likewise, the frequency of S. Enteritidis isolation from feces from conventional cages was significantly greater than from enriched colony cages (at the higher hen stocking density) for the sum of all samples (45.0 vs. 36.7\%) and at 6\,weeks postinoculation. Moreover, the frequency of S. Enteritidis fecal recovery from enriched colony cages at the higher hen stocking was significantly greater than from similar cages at the lower stocking density for all 10 sampling dates combined (39.4 vs. 33.3\%). These results suggest that stocking density can affect S. Enteritidis intestinal colonization and fecal shedding in laying hens, but some other difference between conventional and enriched colony cage systems appears to exert an additional influence.},

  abstract = {Internalization of pathogens poses a tremendous health risk in the consumption of raw fresh produce, because conventional washing cannot remove pathogens effectively after internalization occurs. We investigated (i) the pattern of Salmonella internalization in different parts of green onions when it was contaminated on their surfaces, and (ii) whether environmental factors (extreme weather) affect the extent of Salmonella internalization. Green onions were surface contaminated with three different levels of Salmonella Typhimurium (1, 3, and 5 log CFU per green onion). Each contamination group was irrigated with three different water volumes to mimic water stress and to determine if Salmonella Typhimurium internalization was localized in different parts of the plant. The plants were collected 2 days after contamination, and surface bacteria were inactivated with ethanol and silver nitrate. The plants were then cut into two parts, upper and lower. The internalized Salmonella Typhimurium in each part was visualized and confirmed with a laser scanning confocal microscope and was quantified with the plate count method and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The results indicate that Salmonella Typhimurium can be taken up through the plant surface and transported from the upper to the lower part of the plant. The level of viable internalized Salmonella Typhimurium (plate count) was higher in the lower part than the level in the upper leafy part, especially when the leaves were contaminated with a high concentration of Salmonella (5 log CFU, P {$<$} 0.05), whereas the total internalized Salmonella Typhimurium (by qPCR) was higher in the upper part (P {$<$} 0.05) at the same contamination level. The discrepancy between these results suggests that most internalized Salmonella lost viability in the upper part but survived in the lower part. Water stress did not significantly change the extent of internalization in either location of green onion, whether detected via plate count or qPCR when the contamination occurred on the surface.},

  abstract = {Phage therapy is the use of bacteriophages—viruses that use bacteria as their host cells—as biocontrol agents of bacteria. Currently, phage therapy is garnering renewed interest as bacterial resistance to antibiotics becomes widespread. Historically, phage therapy was largely abandoned in the West in the 1940s due to the advent of chemical antibiotics, and the unreliability of phage-based treatments when compared to antibiotics. The choice of phage strain and the methods of phage preparation are now thought to have been critical to the success or failure of phage therapy trials. Insufficiently virulent phages, especially against actual target bacteria, allow bacteria to survive treatment while poorly prepared phage stocks, even if of sufficiently virulent phages, lack the numbers of viable phages required for adequate treatment. In this review we discuss the factors that determine the methods of isolation, analysis, and identification of phage species for phage therapy. We go on to discuss the various methods available for purifying phages as well as considerations of the degree of purification which is sufficient for various applications. Lastly, we review the current practices used to prepare commercial phage therapy products.},

Mutant analyses and infection studies revealed that all three prophages may individually lead to cell lysis. However, only LambdaSo and MuSo2 form infectious phage particles. Phage release and cell lysis already occur during early stages of static incubation. A mutant devoid of the prophages was significantly less prone to lysis in pure culture. In addition, the phage-less mutant was severely impaired in biofilm formation through all stages of development, and three-dimensional growth occurred independently of eDNA as a structural component. Thus, we suggest that in S. oneidensis MR-1 prophage-mediated lysis results in the release of crucial biofilm-promoting factors, in particular eDNA.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages are the most abundant members of the microbiota and have the potential to shape gut bacterial communities. Changes to bacteriophage composition are associated with disease, but how phages impact mammalian health remains unclear. We noted an induction of host immunity when experimentally treating bacterially driven cancer, leading us to test whether bacteriophages alter immune responses. Treating germ-free mice with bacteriophages leads to immune cell expansion in the gut. Lactobacillus, Escherichia, and Bacteroides bacteriophages and phage DNA stimulated IFN-g via the nucleotide-sensing receptor TLR9. The resultant immune responses were both phage and bacteria specific. Additionally, increasing bacteriophage levels exacerbated colitis via TLR9 and IFN-g. Similarly, ulcerative colitis (UC) patients responsive to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have reduced phages compared to non-responders, and mucosal IFN-g positively correlates with bacteriophage levels. Bacteriophages from active UC patients induced more IFN-g compared to healthy individuals. Collectively, these results indicate that bacteriophages can alter mucosal immunity to impact mammalian health.},

In general, these interactions include two main aspects. The first is the phage immunogenicity, that is, the capacity of phages to induce specific immune responses, in particular the generation of specific antibodies against phage antigens. The other aspect includes the immunomodulatory activity of phages, that is, the nonspecific effects of phages on different functions of major populations of immune cells involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses. These functions include, among others, phagocytosis and the respiratory burst of phagocytic cells, the production of cytokines, and the generation of antibodies against nonphage antigens. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the interactions between phages and cells of the immune system, along with their implications for phage therapy. These topics are presented based on the results of experimental studies and unique data on immunomodulatory effects found in patients with bacterial infections treated with phage preparations.},

  abstract = {Appearance of pathogenic bacteria resistant to most, if not all, known antibiotics is currently one of the most significant medical problems. Therefore, development of novel antibacterial therapies is crucial for efficient treatment of bacterial infections in the near future. One possible option is to employ enzymes, encoded by bacteriophages, which cause destruction of bacterial cell membranes and walls. Bacteriophages use such en­ zymes to destroy bacterial host cells at the final stage of their lytic development, in order to ensure effective liberation of progeny virions. Nevertheless, to use such bacteriophage-encoded proteins in medicine and/or biotechnology, it is crucial to understand details of their biological functions and biochemical properties. Therefore, in this review article, we will present and discuss our current knowledge on the processes of bacteriophage-mediated bacterial cell lysis, with special emphasis on enzymes involved in them. Regulation of timing of the lysis is also discussed. Finally, possibilities of the practical use of these enzymes as antibacterial agents will be underlined and perspectives of this aspect will be presented.},

  abstract = {The appearance of bacteria resistant to most or even all known antibiotics has become a serious medical problem. One such promising and effective alternative form of therapy may be the use of phages, the administration of which is considered to be safe and highly effective, especially in animals with drug-resistant infections. Although there have been no reports to date suggesting that bacteriophages can cause any severe complications or adverse effects, we still know little about their interactions with animal organisms, especially in the context of the functioning of the immune system. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the impact of the application of selected bacteriophages and antibiotics (enrofloxacin and colistin), commonly used in veterinary medicine, on immune functions in               Salmonella enterica               serovar Typhimurium-infected chickens. The birds were infected with S. Typhimurium and then treated with a phage cocktail (14 days), enrofloxacin (5 days), or colistin (5 days). The concentrations of a panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-12) and cytokines that reveal anti-inflammatory effects (IL-10 and IL-4), the percentage of lymphocytes, and the level of stress hormones (corticosterone and cortisol), which significantly modulate the immune responses, were determined in different variants of the experiment. The phage cocktail revealed anti-inflammatory effects when administered either 1 day after infection or 2 days after               S               . Typhimurium detection in feces, as measured by inhibition of the increase in levels of inflammatory response markers (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-12). This was also confirmed by increased levels of cytokines that exert an anti-inflammatory action (IL-10 and IL-4) following phage therapy. Moreover, phages did not cause a negative effect on the number and activity of lymphocytes’ subpopulations crucial for normal immune system function. These results indicate for the first time that phage therapy not only is effective but also can be used in veterinary medicine without disturbing immune homeostasis, expressed as cytokine imbalance, disturbed percentage of key immune cell subpopulations, and stress axis hyperactivity, which were observed in our experiments as adverse effects accompanying the antibiotic therapy.},

Most clusters naturally break into sets of more closely related subclusters, 78\% of which are correlated with their host genera.

  abstract = {Increasing multidrug resistance has led to renewed interest in phage-based therapy. A combination of the bacteriophages and antibiotics presents a promising approach enhancing the phage therapy effectiveness. First, phage candidates for therapy should be deeply characterized. Here we characterize the bacteriophage vB\_AbaP\_AGC01 that poses antibacterial activity against clinical Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Moreover, besides genomic and phenotypic analysis our study aims to analyze phage–antibiotic combination effectiveness with the use of ex vivo and in vivo models. The phage AGC01 efficiently adsorbs to A. baumannii cells and possesses a bacteriolytic lifecycle resulting in high production of progeny phages (317 ± 20 PFU × cell−1). The broad host range (50.27\%, 93 out of 185 strains) against A. baumannii isolates and the inability of AGC01 to infect other bacterial species show its high specificity. Genomic analysis revealed a high similarity of the AGC01 genome sequence with that of the Friunavirus genus from a subfamily of Autographivirinae. The AGC01 is able to significantly reduce the A. baumannii cell count in a human heat-inactivated plasma blood model (HIP-B), both alone and in combination with antibiotics (gentamicin (GEN), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and meropenem (MER)). The synergistic action was observed when a combination of phage treatment with CIP or MER was used. The antimicrobial activity of AGC01 and phage-antibiotic combinations was confirmed using an in vivo larva model. This study shows the greatest increase in survival of G. mellonella larvae when the combination of phage (MOI = 1) and MER was used, which increased larval survival from 35\% to 77\%. Hence, AGC01 represents a novel candidate for phage therapy. Additionally, our study suggests that phages and antibiotics can act synergistically for greater antimicrobial effect when used as combination therapy.},

This paradigm extends to engagements with bacterial biofilms, necessitating novel computational approaches to comprehensively characterize and optimize the outcomes achievable via these combinations. This study aimed to explore the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in optimizing the antibiofilm activity of bacteriophage–antibiotic combinations. We employ a combination of antibiotics (gentamicin, meropenem, amikacin, ceftazidime, fosfomycin, imipenem, and colistin) alongside the bacteriophage vB\_AbaP\_AGC01 to combat Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm. Based on the conducted biofilm challenge assays analyzed using the RSM, the optimal points of antibiofilm activity efficacy were effectively selected by applying this methodology, enabling the quantifiable mathematical representations. Subsequent optimization showed the synergistic potential of the anti-biofilm that arises when antibiotics are judiciously combined with the AGC01 bacteriophage, reducing biofilm biomass by up to 80\% depending on the antibiotic used. The data suggest that the phage–imipenem combination demonstrates the highest efficacy, with an 88.74\% reduction. Notably, the lower concentrations characterized by a high maximum reduction in biofilm biomass were observed in the phage–amikacin combination at cA = 0.00195 and cP = 0.38 as the option that required minimum resources. It is worth noting that only gentamicin antagonism between the phage and the antibiotic was detected.},

  abstract = {The continued rise in antibiotic resistance is precipitating a medical crisis. Bacteriophage (phage) has been hailed as one possible therapeutic option to augment the efficacy of antibiotics. However, only a few studies have addressed the synergistic relationship between phage and antibiotics. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of phage-antibiotic interaction that evaluates synergism, additivism, and antagonism for all classes of antibiotics across clinically achievable stoichiometries. We combined an optically based real-time microtiter plate readout with a matrix-like heat map of treatment potencies to measure phage and antibiotic synergy (PAS), a process we term synography. Phage-antibiotic synography was performed against a pandemic drug-resistant clonal group of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) with antibiotic levels blanketing the MIC across seven orders of viral titers. Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, phages provide an adjuvating effect by lowering the MIC for drug-resistant strains. Furthermore, synergistic and antagonistic interactions are highly dependent on the mechanism of bacterial inhibition by the class of antibiotic paired to the phage, and when synergism is observed, it suppresses the emergence of resistant cells. Host conditions that simulate the infection environment, including serum and urine, suppress PAS in a bacterial growth-dependent manner. Lastly, two different related phages that differed in their burst sizes produced drastically different synograms. Collectively, these data suggest lytic phages can resuscitate an ineffective antibiotic for previously resistant bacteria while also synergizing with antibiotics in a class-dependent manner, processes that may be dampened by lower bacterial growth rates found in host environments.},

  abstract = {We explore the ability of optimal foraging theory to explain the observation among marine bacteriophages that host range appears to be negatively correlated with host abundance in the local marine environment. We modified Charnov's classic diet composition model to describe the ecological dynamics of the related generalist and specialist bacteriophages φX174 and G4, and confirmed that specialist phages are ecologically favored only at high host densities. Our modified model accurately predicted the ecological dynamics of phage populations in laboratory microcosms, but had only limited success predicting evolutionary dynamics. We monitored evolution of attachment rate, the phenotype that governs diet breadth, in phage populations adapting to both low and high host density microcosms. Although generalist φX174 populations evolved even broader diets at low host density, they did not show a tendency to evolve the predicted specialist foraging strategy at high host density. Similarly, specialist G4 populations were unable to evolve the predicted generalist foraging strategy at low host density. These results demonstrate that optimal foraging models developed to explain the behaviorally determined diets of predators may have only limited success predicting the genetically determined diets of bacteriophage, and that optimal foraging probably plays a smaller role than genetic constraints in the evolution of host specialization in bacteriophages.},

  abstract = {Salmonella are important pathogenic bacteria and, following Campylobacter, they are the second most common cause of bacterial foodborne infections worldwide. To reduce the presence of bacteria along the food chain, the application of bacteriophages (phages) may be a promising tool. In this study, the lytic properties of six phages against five relevant Salmonella serotypes (S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Infantis, S. Paratyphi B and S. Indiana) were analyzed. Three phages were able to lyse all five serotypes. We determined the lytic potential of each phage on indicator strains in vitro at room temperature (RT) and at 37 °C using low multiplicities of infection (MOIs). Most phages reduced their host more efficiently at RT than at 37 °C, even at the lowest MOI of 0.001. Following this, the lytic activity of a cocktail comprising five phages (MOI = 0.1) was examined with each of the five serotypes and a mix of them at RT, 15, 12, 10, 8 and 6 °C. All cultures of single serotypes as well as the mixture of strains were significantly reduced at temperatures as low as 8 °C. For single serotypes, reductions of up to 5 log10 units and up to 2.3 log10 units were determined after 6 h (RT) and 40 h (8 °C), respectively. The mixture of strains was reduced by 1.7 log10 units at 8 °C. The data clearly suggest that these phages are suitable candidates for biocontrol of various Salmonella serotypes under food manufacturing conditions.},

Typhimurium, which mainly transmitted to humans through poultry products. In this study we explored the therapeutic potential of a Salmonella phage composition containing a virulent phage and a nonproductive phage that does not produce progeny phage against chicks infected with a pandrug-resistant S. Typhimurium strain of avian origin. After approximately 107 CFU of S. Typhimurium strain ST149 were administrated to chicks by intraperitoneal injection, the phage combination (∼108 PFU) was gavaged at 8-h, 32-h, and 54-h postinfection. At d 10 postinfection, phage treatment completely protected chicks from Salmonella-induced death compared to 91.7\% survival in the Salmonella challenge group. In addition, phage treatment also greatly reduced the bacterial load in various organs, with Salmonella colonization levels decreasing more significantly in spleen and bursa than in liver and cecal contents, possibly due to higher phage titers in these immune organs. However, phages could not alleviate the decreased body weight gain and the enlargement of spleen and bursa of infected chicks. Further examination of the bacterial flora in the cecal contents of chicks found that S. Typhimurium infection caused a remarkable decrease in abundance of Clostridia vadin BB60 group and Mollicutes RF39 (the dominant genus in chicks), making Lactobacillus the dominate genus. Although phage treatment partially restored the decline of Clostridia vadin BB60 group and Mollicutes RF39 and increased abundance of Lactobacillus caused by S. Typhimurium infection, Fournierella that may aggravate intestinal inflammation became the major genus, followed by increased Escherichia-Shigella as the second dominate bacterial genus. These results suggested that successive phage treatment modulated the structural composition and abundance of bacterial communities, but failed to normalize the intestinal microbiome disrupted by S. Typhimurium infection. Phages need to be combined with other means to control the spread of S. Typhimurium in poultry.},

  abstract = {Biofilms are an extremely common adaptation, allowing bacteria to colonize hostile environments. They present unique problems for antibiotics and biocides, both due to the nature of the extracellular matrix and to the presence within the biofilm of metabolically inactive persister cells. Such chemicals can be highly effective against planktonic bacterial cells, while being essentially ineffective against biofilms. By contrast, bacteriophages seem to have a greater ability to target this common form of bacterial growth. The high numbers of bacteria present within biofilms actually facilitate the action of bacteriophages by allowing rapid and efficient infection of the host and consequent amplification of the bacteriophage. Bacteriophages also have a number of properties that make biofilms susceptible to their action. They are known to produce (or to be able to induce) enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. They are also able to infect persister cells, remaining dormant within them, but re-activating when they become metabolically active. Some cultured biofilms also seem better able to support the replication of bacteriophages than comparable planktonic systems. It is perhaps unsurprising that bacteriophages, as the natural predators of bacteria, have the ability to target this common form of bacterial life.},

  abstract = {Within the species of Salmonella enterica, there is significant diversity represented among the numerous subspecies and serovars. Collectively, these account for microbes with variable host ranges, from common plant and animal colonizers to extremely pathogenic and human-specific serovars. Despite these differences, many Salmonella species find commonality in the ability to form biofilms and the ability to cause acute, latent, or chronic disease. The exact outcome of infection depends on many factors such as the growth state of Salmonella, the environmental conditions encountered at the time of infection, as well as the infected host and immune response elicited. Here, we review the numerous biofilm lifestyles of Salmonella (on biotic and abiotic surfaces) and how the production of extracellular polymeric substances not only enhances long-term persistence outside the host but also is an essential function in chronic human infections. Furthermore, careful consideration is made for the events during initial infection that allow for gut transcytosis which, in conjunction with host immune functions, often determine the progression of disease. Both typhoidal and non-typhoidal salmonellae can cause chronic and/or secondary infections, thus the adaptive immune responses to both types of bacteria are discussed with particular attention to the differences between Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Typhimurium, and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella that can result in differential immune responses. Finally, while strides have been made in our understanding of immunity to Salmonella in the lymphoid organs, fewer definitive studies exist for intestinal and hepatobiliary immunity. By examining our current knowledge and what remains to be determined, we provide insight into new directions in the field of Salmonella immunity, particularly as it relates to chronic infection.},

  abstract = {With the increasing global threat of antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to develop new effective therapies to tackle antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Bacteriophage therapy is considered as a possible alternative over antibiotics to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, bacteria can evolve resistance towards bacteriophages through antiphage defense mechanisms, which is a major limitation of phage therapy. The antiphage mechanisms target the phage life cycle, including adsorption, the injection of DNA, synthesis, the assembly of phage particles, and the release of progeny virions. The non-specific bacterial defense mechanisms include adsorption inhibition, superinfection exclusion, restriction-modification, and abortive infection systems. The antiphage defense mechanism includes a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated (Cas) system. At the same time, phages can execute a counterstrategy against antiphage defense mechanisms. However, the antibiotic susceptibility and antibiotic resistance in bacteriophage-resistant bacteria still remain unclear in terms of evolutionary trade-offs and trade-ups between phages and bacteria. Since phage resistance has been a major barrier in phage therapy, the trade-offs can be a possible approach to design effective bacteriophage-mediated intervention strategies. Specifically, the trade-offs between phage resistance and antibiotic resistance can be used as therapeutic models for promoting antibiotic susceptibility and reducing virulence traits, known as bacteriophage steering or evolutionary medicine. Therefore, this review highlights the synergistic application of bacteriophages and antibiotics in association with the pleiotropic trade-offs of bacteriophage resistance.},

Three key features emerge from the comparative analysis of these genomes. First, they span a very high degree of genetic diversity, suggesting early evolutionary origins. Second, the genome architectures are mosaic, reflecting an unusually high degree of horizontal genetic exchange in their evolution. Third, phage genomes contain a very high proportion of novel genetic sequences of unknown function, and probably represent the largest reservoir of unexplored genes. With an estimated 1031 bacterial and archael viruses in the biosphere, our view of the virosphere will draw into sharper focus as further bacteriophage genomes are characterized.},

Because their genomes are relatively small, elucidating the genetic diversity of the phage population, deciphering their origins, and identifying the evolutionary mechanisms that shape the population would seem readily feasible. And yet the pace of phage genome characterization has slowed over the past three years, reflecting partly a need to transition from sequencing known and well-characterized bacteriophages to the isolation and comparative analysis of new isolates. The current state of bacteriophage genomics shows that the genetic diversity of the population is very high, that phages have been actively evolving for billions of years with active engagement of horizontal genetic exchange, and that their genomes are consequently pervasively mosaic in their architectures. But we have barely scratched the surface and the next years of phage genome exploration promise to be especially revealing.},

Although optimal foraging has traditionally been applied to animal behavior, the model is easily applied to viral host range, which is genetically determined. The usual perspective for bacteriophages (bacterial viruses) is that expanding host range is always advantageous if fitness on former hosts is not compromised. However, foraging theory identifies conditions favoring avoidance of poor hosts even if larger host ranges have no intrinsic costs. Bacteriophage T7 rapidly evolved to discriminate among different Escherichia coli strains when one host strain was engineered to kill infecting phages but the other remained productive. After modifying bacteria to yield more subtle fitness effects on T7, we tested qualitative predictions of optimal foraging theory by competing broad and narrow host range phages against each other. Consistent with the foraging model, diet restriction was favored when good hosts were common or there was a large difference in host quality. Contrary to the model, the direction of selection was affected by the density of poor hosts because being able to discriminate was costly.},

Incorporation of radioactive mannose into the phosphomannose isomerase-deficient strain E. coli F860 O9 pmi allowed the derivation of the number of O-antigens per cell required to increase T5 adsorption. With more than 500 O-antigen molecules, acceleration of T5+ adsorption was observed. The highest adsorption rate was obtained when nearly all lipopolysaccharide molecules were substituted with a polymannose O-antigen. Inhibition studies with purified components of an enzymatically degraded lipopolysaccharide of the O8 type showed that among the mannosides tested the smallest unit, the trimannoside, was the strongest inhibitor of T5+ binding. We conclude that the reversible preadsorption to the O8 and O9 polymannose antigens increases the rate of infection via the cellular receptor protein encoded by the fhuA (formerly tonA) gene.},

  abstract = {A multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) was developed and evaluated for the simultaneous detection of Salmonella spp., S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and S. enterica serovar Enteritidis in various (food) matrices. Early and fast detection of these pathogens facilitates effective intervention and prevents further distribution of contaminated food products on the market. Three primer and probe sets were designed to target the invA gene, the STM4200 gene, and the SEN1392 gene to detect and differentiate Salmonella spp., S. Typhimurium, and S. Enteritidis, respectively. The multiplex qPCR targeting these three genes was optimized for efficiency and linearity. By testing 225 Salmonella isolates and 34 non-Salmonella isolates from various sources the inclusivity and exclusivity were determined. The inclusivity of the multiplex qPCR was 100\% for all Salmonella isolates, including 72 S. Typhimurium isolates, and 53 S. Enteritidis isolates. The exclusivity for Salmonella spp., S. Typhimurium, and S. Enteritidis was 100\%, 94.6\%, and 100\%, respectively. No positive results were reported for non-Salmonella isolates. The limit of detection (LOD) for the qPCR was determined for the matrices poultry, minced meat, egg, herbs/spices, powdered milk, fish, animal feed, boot-socks with chicken feces and chicken down. LOD values for qPCR and the conventional culture methods were similar, except for the matrix boot-socks and down, for which the LOD for the conventional culture methods performed better than the qPCR method. In conclusion, the multiplex qPCR assay developed allows for rapid screening of Salmonella spp., S. Typhimurium, and S. Enteritidis in various (food) matrices.},

  abstract = {The production of phages for therapeutic purposes demands fast, efficient and scalable purification procedures. Phage lysates have a wide range of impurities, of which endotoxins of gram-negative bacteria and protein toxins produced by many pathogenic bacterial species are harmful to humans. The highest allowed endotoxin concentration for parenterally applied medicines is 5 EU/kg/h. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of different purification methods in endotoxin and protein toxin removal in the production of phage preparations for clinical use. In the purification assays, we utilized three phages: Escherichia phage vB\_EcoM\_fHoEco02, Acinetobacter phage vB\_ApiM\_fHyAci03, and Staphylococcus phage vB\_SauM\_fRuSau02. The purification methods tested in the study were precipitation with polyethylene glycol, ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, anion exchange chromatography, octanol extraction, two different endotoxin removal columns, and different combinations thereof. The efficiency of the applied purification protocols was evaluated by measuring phage titer and either endotoxins or staphylococcal enterotoxins A and C (SEA and SEC, respectively) from samples taken from different purification steps. The most efficient procedure in endotoxin removal was the combination of ultrafiltration and EndoTrap HD affinity column, which was able to reduce the endotoxin-to-phage ratio of vB\_EcoM\_fHoEco02 lysate from 3.5 × 104 Endotoxin Units (EU)/109 plaque forming units (PFU) to 0.09 EU/109 PFU. The combination of ultrafiltration and anion exchange chromatography resulted in ratio 96 EU/109 PFU, and the addition of octanol extraction step into this procedure still reduced this ratio threefold. The other methods tested either resulted to less efficient endotoxin removal or required the use of harmful chemicals that should be avoided when producing phage preparations for medical use. Ultrafiltration with 100,000 MWCO efficiently removed enterotoxins from vB\_SauM\_fRuSau02 lysate (from 1.3 to 0.06 ng SEA/109 PFU), and anion exchange chromatography reduced the enterotoxin concentration below 0.25 ng/ml, the detection limit of the assay.},

  abstract = {The inflammatory response to parasites, bacteria, and viruses is mediated by multiple host factors. TNF-α is one of the most pleiotropic cytokines in mammals, but has yet to be identified in avian species. In the current study, we isolated a full-length cDNA encoding the chicken homologue of LPS-induced TNF-α factor (LITAF), transcription factor, with an open reading frame of 148 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 16.0kDa. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that chicken LITAF mRNA was predominantly expressed in spleen and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). LITAF mRNA levels were up-regulated following in vitro stimulation of macrophages for 4h with Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium endotoxin, and 18–48h after treatment with Eimeria acervulina, E. maxima, or E. tenella, three causative agents of avian coccidiosis. LITAF mRNA was up-regulated by more than 700-fold in IELs isolated from E. maxima-infected birds. Purified recombinant LITAF protein expressed in E. coli or COS7 cells exhibited cytotoxic activity against chicken tumor cell lines in vitro, presumably through autocrine activation of TNF-α or its chicken homologue. This supposition was strengthened by the fact that treatment of chicken macrophages with recombinant LITAF induced the expression of TL1A (TNFSF 15), a member of the TNF ligand super family. We conclude that chicken LITAF may play an important role in the regulation of TNF-α gene expression during the course of coccidiosis or tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Fowl typhoid is a severe disease caused by Salmonella Gallinarum with considerable mortality and morbidity in laying hen farms. The current study has focused on controlling the infection in laying hens using anti-Salmonella spp. bacteriophage. The treatments included, PC, without challenge; NC, S. Gallinarum challenged (SGC); B5, 5 mg bacteriophage/ kg + SGC; B10, 10 mg bacteriophage/kg + SGC. The Salmonella shedding, inflammatory responses, and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, toll-like receptor (TLR), and heat shock protein (HSP) in the jejunum, liver, and thigh muscle were tested in laying hens. Supplementation of bacteriophage reduced the abundance of S. Gallinarum in the excreta at d 3, 7, and 14. The abundance of S. Gallinarum was lower in the B10 than the B5 at d 7. Supplementation of bacteriophage decreased the abundance of S. Gallinarum in the oviduct, spleen, and cecum at d 14. The laying hens in the NC group showed an increased relative spleen weight compared with the PC and B10 treatments. Among the SGC treatments, the NC treatment showed higher gene expressions of IL-4 compared with the B5, higher gene expressions of interferon (IFNg), TLR4, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) compared with the B5 and B10, and higher gene expressions of HSP27 compared with the B10 in the jejunum. Dietary supplementation of B10 decreased the mRNA expressions of TLR4 and TNF-a compared with the B5 treatment in the jejunum. The NC treatment showed the highest gene expressions of HSP27, TLR4, and TNF-a in the liver. Dietary supplementation of B10 showed lower mRNA expressions of HSP27 compared with the B5 treatment in the liver. Moreover, the IFNg and HSP27 were upregulated in the NC treatment compared with the B5 and B10 in the muscle. In conclusion, it can be suggested that bacteriophage is an effective supplement to control S. Gallinarum infection in laying hens and possibly lower horizontal contaminations in laying hen flocks.},

To address how bacteriophages impact bacterial communities in the gut, we investigated the dynamic effects of phages on a model microbiome. Gnotobiotic mice were colonized with defined human gut commensal bacteria and subjected to predation by cognate lytic phages. We found that phage predation not only directly impacts susceptible bacteria but also leads to cascading effects on other bacterial species via interbacterial interactions. Metabolomic profiling revealed that shifts in the microbiome caused by phage predation have a direct consequence on the gut metabolome. Our work provides insight into the ecological importance of phages as modulators of bacterial colonization, and it additionally suggests the potential impact of gut phages on the mammalian host with implications for their therapeutic use to precisely modulate the microbiome.},

  abstract = {Pullorum disease caused by Salmonella Pullorum remains an important disease for the poultry industry due to high morbidity and mortality in many countries. Phage therapy is becoming an alternative strategy to control multidrug-resistant Salmonella infections in young chicks. However, how bacteriophages affect the growth performance of chicks infected with S. Pullorum remains poorly understood. Herein, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of Salmonella phage CKT1 against hypervirulent arthritis-causing S. Pullorum. The results showed that single phage treatment after hypervirulent S. Pullorum infection significantly improved body weight loss of chicks. Compared with enlarged liver and spleen in only Salmonella challenged group, phage administration substantially reduced the liver/body and spleen/body weight ratios, bacterial loads in organs and the degree of hepatic sinusoidal dilatation and congestion. Moreover, phage CKT1 can enter the organs of chicks and stay for at least 3 d in liver and spleen, and promote higher serum levels of IL-6 production within 6 d postinfection, indicating phage-induced bacterial lysis may be involved in inflammatory immune response to S. Pullorum infection. Analysis of the microbiome of gastrointestinal tract of chicks demonstrated that Salmonella challenge significantly reduced the relative abundances of Lachnoclostridium and Blautia, resulting in remarkably increased Escherichia-Shigella and Klebsiella becoming the predominant bacterial taxa. In contrast, the use of phage CKT1 significantly reduced Escherichia-Shigella and Klebsiella populations in intestine, permitting the proliferation of beneficial microbiota in Firmicutes including Lachnoclostridium, Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus, and Pseudoflavonifractor. In addition, phage alone treatments did not affect the normal gut microbiota structure of chicks, and phage therapy on Salmonella infected chicks increased bacteria species richness in the cecum. These results suggest that Salmonella phage CKT1 could improve growth performance of chicks challenged with S. Pullorum by normalizing the abnormal intestinal microbiome.},

Our work and that of many others, cited above, has documented the potential of bacteriophage to be an effective alternative to antibiotics. There are some perceived and real limitations of the potential of bacteriophage that have affected their acceptance and practicality, which we have discussed in detail in an earlier publication (Huff et al., 2004). Some of these limitations include their specificity, their ability to act as a vehicle of bacterial genes with consequent transformation of infected bacteria, uncertainty over regulatory acceptance of bacteriophage, concern over protection of proprietary rights of bacteriophage products, fragile activity, and practical routes of administration of bacteriophage in animal production systems. Many, if not all, of these limitations can be solved by research. The concept that bacteriophage can be used in several ways to decrease the negative impact of bacterial pathogens on poultry production has been demonstrated, and bacteriophage can provide an effective alternative to antibiotics. The challenge is not whether bacteriophage work, but which bacteria pathogens should we target for bacteriophage control, and how can we make bacteriophage practical within our poultry production systems.},

These include desirable characteristics such as a relatively broad host range and a lack of other characteristics such as carrying toxin genes and the ability to form a lysogen. While phages are commonly isolated first and subsequently characterized, it is possible to alter isolation procedures to bias the isolation toward phages with desirable characteristics. Some of these variations are regularly used by some groups while others have only been shown in a few publications. In this review I will describe (1) isolation procedures and variations that are designed to isolate phages with broader host ranges, (2) characterization procedures used to show that a phage may have utility in phage therapy, including some of the limits of such characterization, and (3) results of a survey and discussion with phage researchers in industry and academia on the practice of characterization of phages.},

At the same time, Salmonella infections are a threat to public health, since contaminated poultry products can lead to zoonotic infections. Antibiotics as feed additives have proven to be an effective prophylactic option to control Salmonella infections, but due to resistance issues in humans and animals, the use of antimicrobials in food animals has been banned in Europe. Hence, there is an urgent need to look for alternative strategies that can protect poultry against Salmonella infections. One such alternative could be to strengthen the innate immune system in young chickens in order to prevent early life infections. This can be achieved by administration of immune modulating molecules that target innate immune cells, for example via feed, or by in-ovo applications. We aimed to review the innate immune system in the chicken intestine; the main site of Salmonella entrance, and its responsiveness to Salmonella infection. Identifying the most important players in the innate immune response in the intestine is a first step in designing targeted approaches for immune modulation.},

  abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major component of the pattern recognition receptor repertoire that detect invading microorganisms and direct the vertebrate immune system to eliminate infection. In chickens, the differential biology of Salmonella serovars (systemic versus gut-restricted localization) correlates with the presence or absence of flagella, a known TLR5 agonist. Chicken TLR5 (chTLR5) exhibits conserved sequence and structural similarity with mammalian TLR5 and is expressed in tissues and cell populations of immunological and stromal origin. Exposure of chTLR5+ cells to flagellin induced elevated levels of chicken interleukin-1β (chIL-1β) but little upregulation of chIL-6 mRNA. Consistent with the flagellin-TLR5 hypothesis, an aflagellar Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium fliM mutant exhibited an enhanced ability to establish systemic infection. During the early stages of infection, the fliM mutant induced less IL-1β mRNA and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration of the gut. Collectively, the data represent the identification and functional characterization of a nonmammalian TLR5 and indicate a role in restricting the entry of flagellated Salmonella into systemic sites of the chicken.},

  abstract = {The growing human population is currently facing an unprecedented challenge on global food production and sustainability. Despite recognizing poultry as one of the most successful and rapidly growing food industries to address this challenge; poultry health and safety remain major issues that entail immediate attention. Bacterial diseases including colibacillosis, salmonellosis, and necrotic enteritis have become increasingly prevalent during poultry production. Likewise, outbreaks caused by consumption of undercooked poultry products contaminated with zoonotic bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Listeria, are a serious public health concern. With antimicrobial resistance problem and restricted use of antibiotics in food producing animals, bacteriophages are increasingly recognized as an attractive natural antibacterial alternative. Bacteriophages have recently shown promising results to treat diseases in poultry, reduce contamination of carcasses, and enhance the safety of poultry products. Omics technologies have been successfully employed to accurately characterize bacteriophages and their genes/proteins important for interaction with bacterial hosts. In this review, the potential of using lytic bacteriophages to mitigate the risk of major poultry-associated bacterial pathogens are explored. This study also explores challenges associated with the adoption of this technology by industries. Furthermore, the impact of omics approaches on studying bacteriophages, their host interaction and applications is discussed.},

  abstract = {The stability of whole bacteriophage ␭ particles, used as a DNA vaccine delivery system has been examined. Phage were found to be highly stable under normal storage conditions. In liquid suspension, no decrease in titre was observed over a 6-month period at 4 and −70 ◦C, and phage stability was unaffected by freeze/thawing. The measured half life of phage in suspension was 36 days at 20 ◦C, 3.4 days at 37 ◦C and 2.3 days at 42 ◦C. Freeze drying of a phage suspension (with or without the stabilizers dry skim milk or trehalose) resulted in 5–20\% residual viability. Following desiccation (with or without stabilizers), measured half lives ranged from 20 to 100 days at 20 ◦C, 2.6 to 38 days at 37 ◦C, 2.1 to 26 days at 42 ◦C, 7 to 33 h at 70 ◦C, and 1.3 to 6 m at 100 ◦C. In all cases the addition of trehalose significantly increased the stability of the desiccated phage. When stored at −70 ◦C, desiccated phage appeared to be stable in the absence of stabilizers. When phage ␭ was diluted into water, a marginal loss in titre was observed over a 2-week period. Over a 24 h period, liquid phage suspensions were stable within the pH range pH 3–11, therefore oral administration of bacteriophage DNA vaccines via drinking water may be possible. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, the most abundant organisms on earth, have the potential to address the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria resulting from the overuse of antibiotics. However, their high specificity and limited host range can hinder their effectiveness. Phage engineering, through the use of gene editing techniques, offers a means to enhance the host range of bacteria, improve phage efficacy, and facilitate efficient cell-free production of phage drugs. To engineer phages effectively, it is necessary to understand the interaction between phages and host bacteria. Understanding the interaction between the receptor recognition protein of bacteriophages and host receptors can serve as a valuable guide for modifying or replacing these proteins, thereby altering the receptor range of the bacteriophage. Research and development focused on the CRISPR-Cas bacterial immune system against bacteriophage nucleic acids can provide the necessary tools to promote recombination and counter-selection in engineered bacteriophage programs. Additionally, studying the transcription and assembly functions of bacteriophages in host bacteria can facilitate the engineered assembly of bacteriophage genomes in non-host environments. This review highlights a comprehensive summary of phage engineering methods, including in-host and out-of-host engineering, and the use of high-throughput methods to understand their role. The main aim of these techniques is to harness the intricate interactions between bacteriophages and hosts to inform and guide the engineering of bacteriophages, particularly in the context of studying and manipulating the host range of bacteriophages. By employing advanced high-throughput methods to identify specific bacteriophage receptor recognition genes, and subsequently introducing modifications or performing gene swapping through in-host recombination or out-of-host synthesis, it becomes possible to strategically alter the host range of bacteriophages. This capability holds immense significance for leveraging bacteriophages as a promising therapeutic approach against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.},

Therefore, the use of antibiotics in livestock production has been strictly controlled. As a result, bacteriophages have attracted increasing research interest as antibiotic alternatives, since they are natural invaders of bacteria. Numerous studies have shown that dietary bacteriophage supplementation could regulate intestinal microbial composition, enhance mucosal immunity and the physical barrier function of the intestinal tract, and play an important role in maintaining intestinal microecological stability and normal body development of animals. The effect of bacteriophages used in animals is influenced by factors such as species, dose, and duration. However, as a category of mobile genetic elements, the high frequency of gene exchange of bacteriophages also poses risks of transmitting ARGs among bacteria. Hence, we summarized the mechanism and efficacy of bacteriophage therapy, and highlighted the feasibility and challenges of bacteriophage utilization in farm animal production, aiming to provide a reference for the safe and effective application of bacteriophages as an antibiotic alternative in livestock and poultry.},

  abstract = {Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) are major players in human urinary tract infections, neonatal bacterial meningitis, and sepsis. Recently, it has been suggested that there might be a zoonotic component to these infections. To determine whether the E. coli contaminating retail poultry are possible extraintestinal pathogens, and to ascertain the source of these contaminants, they were assessed for their genetic similarities to E. coli incriminated in colibacillosis (avian pathogenic E. coli [APEC]), E. coli isolated from multiple locations of apparently healthy birds at slaughter, and human ExPEC. It was anticipated that the retail poultry isolates would most closely resemble avian fecal E. coli since only apparently healthy birds are slaughtered, and fecal contamination of carcasses is the presumed source of meat contamination. Surprisingly, this supposition proved incorrect, as the retail poultry isolates exhibited gene profiles more similar to APEC than to fecal isolates. These isolates contained a number of ExPEC-associated genes, including those associated with ColV virulence plasmids, and many belonged to the B2 phylogenetic group, known to be virulent in human hosts. Additionally, E. coli isolated from the crops and gizzards of apparently healthy birds at slaughter also contained a higher proportion of ExPEC-associated genes than did the avian fecal isolates examined. Such similarities suggest that the widely held beliefs about the sources of poultry contamination may need to be reassessed. Also, the presence of ExPEC-like clones on retail poultry meat means that we cannot yet rule out poultry as a source of ExPEC human disease.},

  abstract = {Salmonella enterica infections result in diverse clinical manifestations. Typhoid fever, caused by S. enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and S. Paratyphi A, is a bacteremic illness but whose clinical features differ from other Gram-negative bacteremias. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars cause self-limiting diarrhea with occasional secondary bacteremia. Primary NTS bacteremia can occur in the immunocompromised host and infants in sub-Saharan Africa. Recent studies on host–pathogen interactions in Salmonellosis using genome sequencing, murine models, and patient studies have provided new insights. The full genome sequences of numerous S. enterica serovars have been determined. The S. Typhi genome, compared to that of S. Typhimurium, harbors many inactivated or disrupted genes. This can partly explain the different immune responses both serovars induce upon entering their host. Similar genome degradation is also observed in the ST313 S. Typhimurium strain implicated in invasive infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Virulence factors, most notably, type III secretion systems, Vi antigen, lipopolysaccharide and other surface polysaccharides, flagella, and various factors essential for the intracellular life cycle of S. enterica have been characterized. Genes for these factors are commonly carried on Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPIs). Plasmids also carry putative virulence-associated genes as well as those responsible for antimicrobial resistance. The interaction of Salmonella pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) leads to inflammasome formation, activation, and recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon-gamma (IFN)-γ. The gut microbiome may be an important modulator of this immune response. S. Typhimurium usually causes a local intestinal immune response, whereas S. Typhi, by preventing neutrophil attraction resulting from activation of TLRs, evades the local response and causes systemic infection. Potential new therapeutic strategies may lead from an increased understanding of infection pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Control strategies to minimize pathogenic bacteria in food animal production are one of the key components in ensuring safer food for consumers. The most significant challenges confronting the food industry, particularly in the major poultry and swine sectors, are antibiotic resistance and resistance to cleaning and disinfection in zoonotic bacteria. In this context, bacteriophages have emerged as a promising tool for zoonotic bacteria control in the food industry, from animals and farm facilities to the final product. Phages are viruses that infect bacteria, with several advantages as a biocontrol agent such as high specificity, self-replication, self-limitation, continuous adaptation, low inherent toxicity and easy isolation. Their development as a biocontrol agent is of particular interest, as it would allow the application of a promising and even necessary “green” technology to combat pathogenic bacteria in the environment. However, bacteriophage applications have limitations, including selecting appropriate phages, legal restrictions, purification, dosage determination and bacterial resistance. Overcoming these limitations is crucial to enhance phage therapy’s effectiveness against zoonotic bacteria in poultry. Thus, this review aims to provide a comprehensive view of the phage-biosanitation strategies for minimizing persistent Salmonella and Campylobacter bacteria in poultry.},

  abstract = {The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of at least 18 species of Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens that can cause chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Bcc organisms possess high levels of innate antimicrobial resistance, and alternative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. One proposed alternative treatment is phage therapy, the therapeutic application of bacterial viruses (or bacteriophages). Recently, some phages have been observed to form larger plaques in the presence of sublethal concentrations of certain antibiotics; this effect has been termed phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS). Those reports suggest that some antibiotics stimulate increased production of phages under certain conditions. The aim of this study is to examine PAS in phages that infect Burkholderia cenocepacia strains C6433 and K56-2. Bcc phages KS12 and KS14 were tested for PAS, using 6 antibiotics representing 4 different drug classes. Of the antibiotics tested, the most pronounced effects were observed for meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline. When grown with subinhibitory concentrations of these three antibiotics, cells developed a chain-like arrangement, an elongated morphology, and a clustered arrangement, respectively. When treated with progressively higher antibiotic concentrations, both the sizes of plaques and phage titers increased, up to a maximum. B. cenocepacia K56-2-infected Galleria mellonella larvae treated with phage KS12 and low-dose meropenem demonstrated increased survival over controls treated with KS12 or antibiotic alone. These results suggest that antibiotics can be combined with phages to stimulate increased phage production and/or activity and thus improve the efficacy of bacterial killing.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages are enigmatic entities that defy definition. Classically, they are specialist viruses that exclusively parasitize bacterial hosts. Yet this definition becomes limiting when we consider their ubiquity in the body coupled with their vast capacity to directly interact with the mammalian host. While phages certainly do not infect nor replicate within mammalian cells, they do interact with and gain unfettered access to the eukaryotic cell structure. With the growing appreciation for the human virome, coupled with our increased application of phages to patients within clinical settings, the potential impact of phage-mammalian interactions is progressively recognized. In this review, we provide a detailed mechanistic overview of how phages interact with the mammalian cell surface, the processes through which said phages are internalized by the cell, and the intracellular processing and fate of the phages. We then summarize the current state-of-the-field with respect to phage-mammalian interactions and their associations with health and disease states.},

  abstract = {The methods currently used for detecting Salmonella in environmental samples require 2 days to produce results and have limited sensitivity. Here, we describe the development and validation of a real-time PCR Salmonella screening method that produces results in 18 to 24 h. Primers and probes specific to the gene invA, group D, and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis organisms were designed and evaluated for inclusivity and exclusivity using a panel of 329 Salmonella isolates representing 126 serovars and 22 non-Salmonella organisms. The invA- and group D-specific sets identified all the isolates accurately. The PCR method had 100\% inclusivity and detected 1 to 2 copies of Salmonella DNA per reaction. Primers specific for Salmonella-differentiating fragment 1 (Sdf-1) in conjunction with the group D set had 100\% inclusivity for 32 S. Enteritidis isolates and 100\% exclusivity for the 297 non-Enteritidis Salmonella isolates. Single-laboratory validation performed on 1,741 environmental samples demonstrated that the PCR method detected 55\% more positives than the Vitek immunodiagnostic assay system (VIDAS) method. The PCR results correlated well with the culture results, and the method did not report any false-negative results. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis documented excellent agreement between the results from the culture and PCR methods (area under the curve, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval of 0.76 to 1.0) confirming the validity of the PCR method., IMPORTANCE This validated PCR method detects 55\% more positives for Salmonella in half the time required for the reference method, VIDAS. The validated PCR method will help to strengthen public health efforts through rapid screening of Salmonella spp. in environmental samples.},

Herein, we discuss the virulence and pathogenesis factors of APEC, review the zoonotic potential, provide the current status of antibiotic resistance and progress in vaccine development, and summarize the alternative control measures being investigated. In addition to the known virulence factors, several other factors including quorum sensing system, secretion systems, two-component systems, transcriptional regulators, and genes associated with metabolism also contribute to APEC pathogenesis. The clear understanding of these factors will help in developing new effective treatments. The APEC isolates (particularly belonging to ST95 and ST131 or O1, O2, and O18) have genetic similarities and commonalities in virulence genes with human uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and neonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC) and abilities to cause urinary tract infections and meningitis in humans. Therefore, the zoonotic potential of APEC cannot be undervalued. APEC resistance to almost all classes of antibiotics, including carbapenems, has been already reported. There is a need for an effective APEC vaccine that can provide protection against diverse APEC serotypes. Alternative therapies, especially the virulence inhibitors, can provide a novel solution with less likelihood of developing resistance.},

  abstract = {Phages are known to effectively kill extracellularly multiplying bacteria as they do not have the ability of intracellular penetration within the animal cells. However, the present manuscript focuses on studying the impact of surface-adsorbed phage particles on the killing of engulfed Staphylococcus aureus inside phagocytic cells. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured, followed by evaluation of their ability of bacterial uptake and killing. The intracellular killing potential of macrophages in the presence of unadsorbed free phage as well as phage adsorbed onto S. aureus 43300 was studied. Phage added alone to macrophage preparation did not influence intracellular killing of engulfed S. aureus by macrophages. However, phage adsorbed onto host bacterial cells (utilizing host bacteria as a vehicle to carry the lytic phage into the phagocytic compartment) brought about time-dependent and titre-dependent significant reduction in the number of viable intracellular cocci. Phage particles that shuttled inside the macrophage along with bacteria also significantly reduced cytotoxic damage caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). This in turn enhanced the bactericidal killing potential of phagocytic cells. In earlier studies the inability of phages to kill intracellular bacteria has been thought to be a major drawback of phage therapy. For the first time results of this study confirm the killing ability of the broad host range lytic phage MR-5 of both extracellular as well as intracellular engulfed S. aureus inside macrophages. This approach shall not only restrict intracellular proliferation of staphylococci within the myeloid cells but also protect the host from further relapse of infection and treatment failures.},

  abstract = {Trehalose, a naturally occurring osmolyte, is known to be an exceptional stabilizer of proteins and helps retain the activity of enzymes in solution as well as in the freeze-dried state. To understand the mechanism of action of trehalose in detail, we have conducted a thorough investigation of its effect on the thermal stability in aqueous solutions of five well characterized proteins differing in their various physico-chemical properties. Among them, RNase A has been used as a model enzyme to investigate the effect of trehalose on the retention of enzymatic activity upon incubation at high temperatures. 2 m trehalose was observed to raise the transition temperature, T m of RNase A by as much as 18 °C and Gibbs free energy by 4.8 kcal mol–1 at pH 2.5. There is a decrease in the heat capacity of protein denaturation (ΔC p) in trehalose solutions for all the studied proteins. An increase in the ΔG and a decrease in the ΔC p values for all the proteins points toward a general mechanism of stabilization due to the elevation and broadening of the stability curve (ΔG versus T). A direct correlation of the surface tension of trehalose solutions and the thermal stability of various proteins has been observed. Wyman linkage analysis indicates that at 1.5 m concentration 4–7 molecules of trehalose are excluded from the vicinity of protein molecules upon denaturation. We further show that an increase in the stability of proteins in the presence of trehalose depends upon the length of the polypeptide chain. The pH dependence data suggest that even though the charge status of a protein contributes significantly, trehalose can be expected to work as a universal stabilizer of protein conformation due to its exceptional effect on the structure and properties of solvent water compared with other sugars and polyols.},

  abstract = {Background               Bacteriophages are viral predators of bacteria and are common in nature. Their host-specific infections against specific bacteria make them an attractive natural agent to control bacterial pathogens. Interest in the potential of bacteriophages as antibacterial agents in the production animal industries has increased.                                         Methods                                A total of 18 bacteriophages were isolated from Australian commercial poultry environments, from which three highly active phages were chosen for enrichment. Sequencing libraries were prepared using a Nextera XT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using 2 × 300 bp paired-end chemistry. The sequence data were then assembled and aligned with a2 bacteriophage as the reference. An animal trial was performed by oral gavaging                 Clostridium perfringens                 netB containing strain EHE-NE18 to the Ross 308 broiler chickens prior inoculation with                 Eimeria                 species. The chickens were raised following the management guide for Ross 308 from d 0 to d 21 and fed with starter and grower diets met the specific breed nutrient requirements. Body weight gain and feed intake were measured on d 9 and d 21 and FCR adjusted with mortality was calculated.                                                        Results                                The isolated bacteriophages only had only 96.7\% similarity to the most closely related, previously characterized,                 Clostridium                 bacteriophage indicated that they might represent a novel strain of bacteriophage. A “cocktail” containing the three bacteriophages was capable of lysing four known disease-inducing                 C. perfringens                 strains                 in vitro                 . Oral administration of the bacteriophages cocktail to broilers challenged with necrotic enteritis markedly alleviated intestinal necrotic lesions in the duodenum and jejunum on day 16 post-hatch. The phage treatment significantly reduced the lesion scores of birds challenged with NE (                 P                 \&lt; 0.01), and the lesion scores between birds treated with the bacteriophages and the unchallenged birds were not statistically different (                 P                 \&gt; 0.05). However, no effect on the growth performance was observed during the recorded period of days 9-21.                                                        Conclusion                                These findings suggest that bacteriophage treatment is a promising approach to protect intestinal health from                 C. perfringens                 induced necrotic enteritis. Further research will be required on the dosing, route of administration, and large scale validation studies to further advance this approach to pathogen control.},

  abstract = {Phage therapy, treating bacterial infections with bacteriophages, could be a future alternative to antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections. There are, however, several problems to be solved, mainly associated to the biology of phages, the interaction between phages and their bacterial hosts, but also to the vast variation of pathogenic bacteria which implies that large numbers of different phages are going to be needed. All of these phages must under present regulation of medical products undergo extensive clinical testing before they can be applied. It will consequently be of great economic importance that effective and versatile phages are selected and collected into phage libraries, i.e., the selection must be carried out in a way that it results in highly virulent phages with broad host ranges. We have isolated phages using the Escherichia coli reference (ECOR) collection and compared two methods, spot testing and efficiency of plating (EOP), which are frequently used to identify phages suitable for phage therapy. The analyses of the differences between the two methods show that spot tests often overestimate both the overall virulence and the host range and that the results are not correlated to the results of EOP assays. The conclusion is that single dilution spot tests cannot be used for identification and selection of phages to a phage library and should be replaced by EOP assays. The difference between the two methods can be caused by many factors. We have analysed if the differences and lack of correlation could be caused by lysis from without, bacteriocins in the phage lysate, or by the presence of prophages harbouring genes coding for phage resistance systems in the genomes of the bacteria in the ECOR collection.},

A 49\% increase in the DEGs on day 7 compared with day 3 post-infection (p.i.) suggested a time-dependent role of multiple genes such as AvBD1, AvBD2, AvBD7, IL2, IL10, IL21, SIVA1, CD5, CD14 and GPR142 in the regulation of the immune system. Nested network analysis of the individual biological pathways showed that IL6 played a significant role in the immune system regulation by activating the pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Salmonella infection, intestinal immune network for IgA production and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway. The downregulated DEGs (FDR {$<$} 0.05; log2 fold change {$<$} −1) showed that Salmonella challenge affected the functions of pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism, retinol metabolism, folate biosynthesis and pentose and glucoronate interconversions, suggesting the disruption of cellular mechanisms involved in nutrient synthesis, absorption and metabolism. Overall, the immune response was temporally regulated through the activation of Toll-like signaling receptor pathway, cytokine-cytokine interactions and Salmonella infection, where IL6 played a significant role in the modulation of caecal immune system against Salmonella Typhimurium.},

Three lytic bacteriophages, KaiHaiDragon, OneinaGillian, and YuuY, were isolated from M. foliorum strain NRRL B-24224. Phage YuuY in particular expresses a broad host range as it possesses the ability to infect closely related bacterial species Microbacterium aerolatum at a high plating efficiency. Characterization tests were performed on all three Microbacterium phage to assess morphology, genomic characteristics, pH and thermal stabilities, life cycle, and the type of receptor used for infection. All three phages showed similar pH stability, ranging from pH 5–11, except for KaiHaiDragon, which had a reduced infection effectiveness at a pH of 11. YuuY possessed a significantly higher temperature tolerance compared to the other Microbacterium phages as some phage particles remained viable after incubation temperatures of up to 80 °C. Based on the one-step growth curve assay, all three Microbacterium phages possessed a relatively short latent period of 90 min and an approximately two-fold burst size factor. Moreover, all three phages utilize a carbohydrate receptor to initiate infection. Based on bioinformatics analysis, YuuY, KaiHaiDragon and OneinaGillian were assigned to clusters EA10, EC, and EG, respectively.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            The potential of bacteriophage as an alternative biocontrol agent has recently been revisited due to the widespread occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We isolated a virulent bacteriophage, SPC35, that can infect both               Salmonella enterica               serovar Typhimurium and               Escherichia coli               . Morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy and analysis of its 118,351-bp genome revealed that SPC35 is a T5 group phage belonging to the family               Siphoviridae               . BtuB, the outer membrane protein for vitamin B               12               uptake, was found to be a host receptor for SPC35. Interestingly, resistant mutants of both               E. coli               and               S.               Typhimurium developed faster than our expectation when the cultures were infected with SPC35. Investigation of the               btuB               gene revealed that it was disrupted by the IS               2               insertion sequence element in most of the resistant               E. coli               isolates. In contrast, we could not detect any               btuB               gene mutations in the resistant               S.               Typhimurium isolates; these isolates easily regained sensitivity to SPC35 in its absence, suggesting phase-variable phage resistance/sensitivity. These results indicate that a cocktail of phages that target different receptors on the pathogen should be more effective for successful biocontrol.},

  abstract = {Salmonella spp. are among the major food-borne pathogens that cause mild diarrhea to severe bacteremia. The use of bacteriophages to control various food-borne pathogens, including Salmonella, has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional chemotherapy. We isolated the Siphoviridae family phage SSU5, which can infect only rough strains of Salmonella. The blocking of SSU5 adsorption by periodate treatment of host Salmonella cells and spotting and adsorption assays with mutants that contain various truncations in their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cores revealed that the outer core region of the LPS is a receptor of SSU5. SSU5 could infect O-antigen (O-Ag)-deficient Salmonella mutants that developed by challenging of O-Ag-specific phages, and consequently, it delayed the emergence of the phage-resistant Salmonella population in broth culture when treated together with phages using O-Ag as a receptor. Therefore, these results suggested that phage SSU5 would be a promising auxiliary component of a phage cocktail to control rough strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which might emerge as resistant mutants upon infection by phages using O-Ag as a receptor.},

This systematic review aims to investigate the reported economic burden of NTS and iNTS infection, identify research gaps, and suggest future research directions. Data from PubMed and Embase databases up to April 2022 were reviewed, and articles were screened based on predefined criteria. Cost data were extracted, categorized into direct medical costs (DMCs), direct non-medical costs (DNMCs), and indirect costs (ICs), and converted into US dollars (year 2022). Data primarily originated from high-income countries (37 out of 38), with limited representation from Africa and resource-limited settings. For inpatients, DMCs were the primary cost driver for both NTS and iNTS illnesses, with estimates ranging from USD 545.9 (Taiwan, a region of China) to USD 21,179.8 (Türkiye) for NTS and from USD 1973.1 (Taiwan, a region of China) to USD 32,507.5 (United States of America) for iNTS per case. DNMCs and ICs varied widely across studies. Although study quality improved over time, methodological differences persisted. This review underscores the lack of economic data on NTS and iNTS in resource-limited settings. It also highlights the need for economic burden data in resource-limited settings and a standardized approach to generate global datasets, which is critical for informing policy decisions, especially regarding future vaccines.},

The treatment with antibiotics favors the selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria and an alternative to this treatment is urgently required. A chicken model of intestinal colonization with an apathogenic model strain of E. coli was used to test if oral phage application can prevent or reduce the gut colonization of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli variants in two individual experiments. The E. coli strain E28 was used as a model strain, which could be differentiated from other E. coli strains colonizing the broiler gut, and was susceptible to all cocktail phages applied. In the first trial, a mixture of six phages was continuously applied via drinking water. No reduction of the model E. coli strain E28 occurred, but phage replication could be demonstrated. In the second trial, the applied mixture was limited to the four phages, which showed highest efficacy in vitro. E. coli colonization was reduced in this trial, but again, no reduction of the E. coli strain E28 was observed. The results of the trials presented here can improve the understanding of the effect of phages on single strains in the multi-strain microbiota of the chicken gut.},

Finally, the phage reaches the last barrier, the cell wall, injects its DNA, and infects the cell. Recently, similar enzymes from bacteriophages of the Ackermannviridae, Myoviridae, and Siphoviridae families were also described. In this mini-review the diversity and function of phage encoded CPS-, EPS-, and LPSdegrading depolymerases is summarized.

In contrast, the unimolecular spanins, like gp11 from phage T1, have an N-terminal lipoylation signal sequence and a C-terminal transmembrane domain to account for the topology requirements.

All phages were examined for their host range on a set of different E. coli strains, originating, e.g., from human diagnostic laboratories or poultry farms. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a diversity of morphotypes (70\% Myo-, 22\% Sipho-, and 8\% Podoviruses), and genome sequencing resulted in genomes sizes from \textasciitilde 44 to \textasciitilde 370 kb. Annotation and comparison with databases showed similarities in particular to T4- and T5-like phages, but also to less-known groups. Though various phages against E. coli are already described in literature and databases, we still isolated phages that showed no or only few similarities to other phages, namely phages Goslar, PTXU04, and KWBSE43-6. Genome-based phylogeny and classification of the newly isolated phages using VICTOR resulted in the proposal of new genera and led to an enhanced taxonomic classification of E. coli phages.},

Bacteriophages have come under increasing interest for anti-Salmonella biofilm control. In this study, we used the three previously sequenced and described phages UPWr\_S1, UPWr\_S3, and UPWr\_S4 and a phage cocktail, UPWr\_S134, containing these three phages to degrade biofilms formed by two S. Enteritidis strains, 327 lux and ATCC 13076, in vitro. It was found that treatment with bacteriophages significantly reduced biofilm on a 96-well microplate (32–69\%) and a stainless steel surface (52–98\%) formed by S. Enteritidis 327 lux. The reduction of biofilm formed by S. Enteritidis ATCC 13076 in the 96-well microplate and on a stainless steel surface for bacteriophage treatment was in the range of 73–87\% and 60–97\%, respectively. Under laboratory conditions, an experimental model utilizing poultry drinkers artificially contaminated with S. Enteritidis 327 lux and treated with UPWr\_S134 phage cocktail was applied. In in vitro trials, the phage cocktail significantly decreased the number of Salmonella on the surface of poultry drinkers. Moreover, the phage cocktail completely eradicated Salmonella from the abundant bacterial load on poultry drinkers in an experimentally infected chickens. Therefore, the UPWr\_S134 phage cocktail is a promising candidate for Salmonella biocontrol at the farm level.},

Kinetics of lytic development of vB\_Sen-TO17 and vB\_Sen-E22, determined in one-step growth experiments, indicated that development is complete within 30–40 min at 42 ◦C, whereas burst sizes vary from 9 to 79 progeny phages per cell for vB\_Sen-TO17 and from 18 to 64 for vB\_Sen-E22, depending on the host strain. Virions of both phages were relatively stable (from several percent to almost 100\% survivability) under various conditions, including acidic and alkaline pH values (from 3 to 12), temperatures from −80 ◦C to 60 ◦C, 70\% ethanol, chloroform, and 10\% DMSO. These characteristics of vB\_Sen-TO17 and vB\_Sen-E22 indicate that these phages might be considered in further studies on phage therapy, particularly in attempts to eliminate S. enterica from chicken intestine.},

  abstract = {Phage therapy is a promising alternative treatment of bacterial infections in human and animals. Nevertheless, despite the appearance of many bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics, these drugs still remain important therapeutics used in human and veterinary medicine. Although experimental phage therapy of infections caused by Salmonella enterica was described previously by many groups, those studies focused solely on effects caused by bacteriophages. Here, we compared the use of phage therapy (employing a cocktail composed of two previously isolated and characterized bacteriophages, vB\_SenM-2 and vB\_Sen-TO17) and antibiotics (enrofloxacin and colistin) in chickens infected experimentally with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. We found that the efficacies of both types of therapies (i.e. the use of antibiotics and phage cocktail) were high and very similar to one another when the treatment was applied shortly (one day) after the infection. Under these conditions, S. Typhimurium was quickly eliminated from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), to the amount not detectable by the used methods. However, later treatment (2 or 4 days after detection of S. Typhimurium in chicken feces) with the phage cocktail was significantly less effective. Bacteriophages remained in the GIT for up to 2-3 weeks, and then were absent in feces and cloaca swabs. Interestingly, both phages could be found in various organs of chickens though with a relatively low abundance. No development of resistance of S. Typhimurium to phages or antibiotics was detected during the experiment. Importantly, although antibiotics significantly changed the GIT microbiome of chickens in a long-term manner, analogous changes caused by phages were transient, and the microbiome normalized a few weeks after the treatment. In conclusion, phage therapy against S. Typhimurium infection in chickens appeared as effective as antibiotic therapy (with either enrofloxacin or colistin), and less invasive than the use the antibiotics as fewer changes in the microbiome were observed.},

  abstract = {In light of spreading antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria, the development of novel approaches to combat such microorganisms is crucial. Salmonella enterica is pathogenic to humans, however, it can also infect poultry, being a potential foodborne pathogen when poultry-derived food is contaminated by this bacterium. Phage therapy is one of the alternative ways to treat Salmonella-infected animals while the establishment of this method and its introduction to a general practice requires detailed studies on safety and efficacy. Here, we present the results of such studies with two previously isolated and characterized bacteriophages, vB\_SenM2 and vB\_Sen-TO17, and four strains of S. enterica belonging to two serovars, Typhimurium and Enteritidis. We demonstrated effective reduction of bacterial cell number and cell culture density when using each phage alone, and in combination (as a cocktail). These phages were also effective in reducing bacterial biofilm. The efficacy of this in vitro phage therapy was compared to the action of known antibiotics, as was the efficiency of appearance of bacteria resistant to both these types of antibacterial agents. Safety of the use of bacteriophages was demonstrated using the LAL chromogenic test and the chicken fibroblast viability assay. Finally, the efficacy of phage therapy was assessed with the in vivo model of S. enterica-infected Galleria mellonella larvae, showing a significant improvement in the survival of the animals. In conclusion, we demonstrated high efficacy and acceptable safety profiles of phage therapy against S. enterica strains using vB\_SenM-2 and vB\_Sen-TO17 phages (both alone and in a cocktail). These results open a possibility for a trial with the use of poultry and these phages which might potentially allow to introduce of this method for practical use in poultry farming.},

  abstract = {An increase in confirmed human salmonellosis cases in the EU after 2014 triggered investigation of contributory factors and control options in poultry production. Reconsideration of the five current target serovars for breeding hens showed that there is justification for retaining Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic variants) and Salmonella Infantis, while Salmonella Virchow and Salmonella Hadar could be replaced by Salmonella Kentucky and either Salmonella Heidelberg, Salmonella Thompson or a variable serovar in national prevalence targets. However, a target that incorporates all serovars is expected to be more effective as the most relevant serovars in breeding flocks vary between Member State (MS) and over time. Achievement of a 1\% target for the current target serovars in laying hen flocks is estimated to be reduced by 254,400 CrI95[98,540; 602,700] compared to the situation in 2016. This translates to a reduction of 53.4\% CrI95[39.1; 65.7] considering the layer-associated human salmonellosis true cases and 6.2\% considering the overall human salmonellosis true cases in the 23 MSs included in attribution modelling. A review of risk factors for Salmonella in laying hens revealed that overall evidence points to a lower occurrence in non-cage compared to cage systems. A conclusion on the effect of outdoor access or impact of the shift from conventional to enriched cages could not be reached. A similar review for broiler chickens concluded that the evidence that outdoor access affects the occurrence of Salmonella is inconclusive. There is conclusive evidence that an increased stocking density, larger farms and stress result in increased occurrence, persistence and spread of Salmonella in laying hen flocks. Based on scientific evidence, an impact of Salmonella control programmes, apart from general hygiene procedures, on the prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler flocks at the holding and on broiler meat at the end of the slaughter process is not expected.},

Phage- and bactierial-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns released after bacterial lysis have been proposed to stimulate local innate immune responses, which could promote antitumor immunity or bacterial clearance. Conversely, immunogenicity of phages induces phage-specific humoral memory, which can hamper therapeutic success. This review outlines the current knowledge on the different types of immune responses elicited by phages and their potential benefits and adverse side effects, when applied therapeutically. This review further summarizes the knowledge gaps and defines the key immunological questions that need to be addressed regarding the clinical application of antibacterial phage therapy.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is a poultry-associated pathogen that is considered one of the most important zoonotic bacterial agents of contaminated food of animal origin including poultry products. Many efforts are taken to eliminate it from the food chain, and phages are one of the most promising tools to control Salmonella in poultry production. We investigated the usefulness of the UPWr\_S134 phage cocktail in reducing Salmonella in broiler chickens. For this purpose, we analyzed the survivability of phages in the harsh environment encountered in the chicken gastrointestinal tract, which has low pH, high temperatures, and digestive activity. Phages in the cocktail UPWr\_S134 showed the ability to remain active after storage at temperatures ranging from 4 to 42°C, reflecting temperatures of storage conditions, broiler handling, and the chicken body, and exhibited robust pH stability. We found that although simulated gastric fluids (SGF) caused phage inactivation, the addition of feed to gastric juice allows maintenance of UPWr\_S134 phage cocktail activity. Further, we analyzed UPWr\_S134 phage cocktail anti-Salmonella activity in live animals such as mice and broilers. In an acute infection model in mice, the application of doses of 107 and 1014 PFU/ml UPWr\_S134 phage cocktail resulted in delaying symptoms of intrinsic infection in all analyzed treatment schedules. In Salmonella-infected chickens orally treated with the UPWr\_S134 phage cocktail the number of pathogens in internal organs in comparison to untreated birds was significantly lower. Therefore we concluded that the UPWr\_S134 phage cocktail could be an effective tool against this pathogen in the poultry industry.},

  abstract = {Background The host-unrestricted, non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S.~Enteritidis) and the serovar Typhimurium (S.~Typhimurium) are major causative agents of food-borne gastroenteritis, and the host-restricted Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum (S.~Gallinarum) is responsible for fowl typhoid. Increasing drug resistance in Salmonella contributes to the reduction of effective therapeutic and/or preventive options. Bacteriophages appear to be promising~antibacterial~tools, able to combat infectious diseases caused by a wide range of Salmonella strains belonging to both host-unrestricted and host-restricted Salmonella serovars. Methods In this study, five novel lytic Salmonella phages, named UPWr\_S1-5, were isolated and characterized, including host range determination by plaque formation, morphology visualization with transmission electron microscopy, and establishment of physiological parameters. Moreover, phage genomes were sequenced, annotated and analyzed, and their genomes were compared with reference Salmonella phages by use of average nucleotide identity, phylogeny, dot plot, single nucleotide variation and protein function analysis. Results It was found that UPWr\_S1-5 phages belong to the genus Jerseyvirus within the Siphoviridae family. All UPWr\_S phages were found to efficiently infect various Salmonella serovars. Host range determination revealed differences in host infection profiles and exhibited ability to infect Salmonella enterica serovars such as Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Senftenberg, Stanley and Chester. The lytic life cycle of UPWr\_S phages was confirmed using the mitomycin C test assay. Genomic analysis revealed that genomes of UPWr\_S phages are composed of 51 core and 19 accessory genes, with 33 of all predicted genes having assigned functions. UPWr\_S genome organization comparison revealed 3 kinds of genomes and mosaic structure. UPWr\_S phages showed very high sequence similarity to each other, with more than 95\% average nucleotide identity. Conclusions Five novel UPWr\_S1-5 bacteriophages were isolated and characterized. They exhibit host lysis range within 5 different serovars and are efficient in lysis of both host-unrestricted and host-restricted Salmonella serovars. Therefore, because of their ability to infect various Salmonella serovars and lytic life cycle, UPWr\_S1-5 phages can be considered as useful tools in biological control of salmonellosis.

  abstract = {Phages (bacterial viruses) are the most numerous microorganisms on Earth. Bacteria have developed an astonishing array of strategies to combat these viruses at each step of the infection process. Here we describe these strategies and how phages have adapted to subvert them.Phage adsorption to cell receptors is the initial step of infection, and some bacterial strains have developed mechanisms to prevent this key process. There are at least three strategies used by adsorption-blocking systems: receptor blocking, extracellular matrix production and competitive inhibitor production.Superinfection exclusion (Sie) systems prevent phage DNA entry into the host cell, thereby conferring bacterial immunity against superinfecting phages. Several mechanisms that inhibit phage DNA injection have been uncovered in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.The notorious bacterial restriction–modification systems prevent phage infection by cleaving phage genomic DNA. As a response, phages have evolved by specifically modifying their genomes to avoid DNA cleavage. This ongoing battle of co-evolution between bacteria and phages is exemplified by the canonical coliphage T4.Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes are new fascinating topics. The bacterial and archeal CRISPR–Cas systems confer immunity against incoming foreign DNA such as phage genomes. A likely mode of action of this mechanism has been proposed, along with phage strategies to circumvent this system.Bacteria have also evolved a plethora of intracellular proteins that cause abortion of the phage infection. These antiphage mechanisms target crucial steps of phage multiplication, such as transcription, protein synthesis, maturation and host cell lysis. Several different abortive infection (Abi) systems have been found, and the mode of action has been studied for a few of these.},

Lysins have specific structures and mechanisms to exert antibacterial effect against both Gram-positive (G+ve) and Gram-negative (G-ve) bacteria. However, its use against G-ve bacteria is limited because the outer membrane (OM) of G-ve bacteria hinders the permeation of exogenously applied lysins. Besides identifying lysins with intrinsic OM permeability, several other approaches including combining lysins with outer membrane permeabilizers (OMPs), protein engineering and formulating with nanocarriers have been proposed to enhance the permeability and activity of lysins. In the present review, we summarize strategies that have been developed to enable lysins to target G-ve bacteria in the past decade. While lysins demonstrates clear potential in managing bacterial infections caused by the drug-resistant G-ve bacteria, there are still challenges hindering their translation into clinical settings, including safety issues with OMP use, low efficiency against stationary phase bacteria and problems in stability. The applicability of protein engineering and formulation sciences to improve enzyme stability, and combination therapy with other classes of antibacterial agents to maximize the therapeutic potential have also been reviewed.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophage (phage) are both predators and evolutionary drivers for bacteria, notably contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes by generalized transduction. Our current understanding of this complex relationship is limited. We used an interdisciplinary approach to quantify how these interacting dynamics can lead to the evolution of multidrug-resistant bacteria. We cocultured two strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, each harboring a different antibiotic resistance gene, with generalized transducing phage. After a growth phase of 8 h, bacteria and phage surprisingly coexisted at a stable equilibrium in our culture, the level of which was dependent on the starting concentration of phage. We detected double-resistant bacteria as early as 7 h, indicating that transduction of AMR genes had occurred. We developed multiple mathematical models of the bacteria and phage relationship and found that phage-bacteria dynamics were best captured by a model in which phage burst size decreases as the bacteria population reaches stationary phase and where phage predation is frequency-dependent. We estimated that one in every 108 new phage generated was a transducing phage carrying an AMR gene and that double-resistant bacteria were always predominantly generated by transduction rather than by growth. Our results suggest a shift in how we understand and model phage-bacteria dynamics. Although rates of generalized transduction could be interpreted as too rare to be significant, they are sufficient in our system to consistently lead to the evolution of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Currently, the potential of phage to contribute to the growing burden of AMR is likely underestimated.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, bacterial viruses, are now being re-highlighted as one of the promising alternative antimicrobial agents to control bacterial pathogens in various fields, including the food industry. However, wild-type (WT) phages isolated from nature are vulnerable to external stresses such as heat, limiting the usability of phages in thermal processing. Here, we applied an adaptive laboratory evolution approach to improving the heat stability of newly isolated Salmonella-infecting lytic phage ΦYMFM0293 and examined its application in the poultry scalding process. After 15 cycles of exposure to sub-lethal temperature, the obtained adaptively evolved (AE) phages maintained approximately 3-log more infectious particles at 73 or 74 ◦C than the WT and non-heattreated control phages. Missense mutations mainly concentrated in the genes related to the phage tail module were identified from the independently obtained heat-challenged phages, regardless of host Salmonella’s heatshock protein chaperone induction. These results demonstrated the necessity and sufficiency of the phage ex­ posures to heat for thermal adaptation and suggested the involvement of the phage tail in heat stability. No significant physiological or morphological changes except the mutually offsetting phage replication parameters were observed in the AE phages. Accordingly, hot water supplemented with the AE phages significantly reduced the number of artificially contaminated Salmonella cells on chicken and duck skin in the mimicked scalding process. The AE strategy used here could be applied to other WT phages to improve their usability as more feasible antimicrobials for food safety.},

  abstract = {Typhoid is a distinct gastrointestinal disease that largely affects the public by consumption of inadequately or partially cooked eggs from contaminated laying hen farms. This has led the research on laying hens to focus on controlling the contamination by an effective anti-Salmonella spp. agent in the intestine. The treatments included, control, without challenge; PC, Salmonella typhimurium challenged (STC); BP5, 5 ppm bacteriophage/kg + STC; BP10, 10 ppm bacteriophage/kg + STC, on Salmonella shedding, body organs inflammatory reactions, and expression of toll-like receptor (TLR), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and heat shock protein (HSP) in the jejunum, liver,and thigh muscle in the STC laying hens. The RT-PCR method was used to enumerate the number of Salmonella typhimurium in the organs. The birds in the STC groups exhibited the increased population of Salmonella spp. in the excreta (p {$<$} .01). In the STC groups, the BP5 and BP10 laying hens exhibited a lower (p {$<$} .01) population of Salmonella spp. in the excreta at d 7 after STC. Supplementation of bacteriophage significantly decreased (p {$<$} .01) the colonization of S. Typhimurium in the spleen, oviduct, caecum and excreta. Among the STC treatments, the BP10 laying hens showed lower (p {$<$} .01) mRNA expression of interferon-γ (IFNγ) and TLR-4 in the jejunum compared with the PC treatment. After the STC, dietary supplementation with BP5 or BP10 decreased (p {$<$} .01) the mRNA expressions of IFNγ, HSP-27 and tumour necrosis factor-α in the liver compared with the PC treatment. These results suggest that bacteriophage can be used as an effective agent to decrease S. Typhimurium contamination in laying hens and possibly lower S. Typhimurium transfer to foods.},

  abstract = {Phage therapy has been viewed as a potential treatment for bacterial infections for over a century. Yet, the year 2016 marks one of the first phase I/II human trials of a phage therapeutic - to treat burn wound patients in Europe. The slow progress in realizing clinical therapeutics is matched by a similar dearth in principled understanding of phage therapy. Theoretical models and in vitro experiments find that combining phage and bacteria often leads to coexistence of both phage and bacteria or phage elimination altogether. Both outcomes stand in contrast to the stated goals of phage therapy. A potential resolution to the gap between models, experiments, and therapeutic use of phage is the hypothesis that the combined effect of phage and host immune system can synergistically eliminate bacterial pathogens. Here, we propose a phage therapy model that considers the nonlinear dynamics arising from interactions between bacteria, phage and the host innate immune system. The model builds upon earlier efforts by incorporating a maximum capacity of the immune response and density-dependent immune evasion by bacteria. We analytically identify a synergistic regime in this model in which phage and the innate immune response jointly contribute to the elimination of the target bacteria. Crucially, we find that in this synergistic regime, neither phage alone nor the innate immune system alone can eliminate the bacteria. We confirm these findings using numerical simulations in biologically plausible scenarios. We utilize our numerical simulations to explore the synergistic effect and its significance for guiding the use of phage therapy in clinically relevant applications.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is regarded as the predominant cause of foodborne illnesses worldwide, and the increase of these antimicrobial-resistant strains makes it more difficult to prevent. On this occasion, bacteriophages (phages) stand out as an alternative biocontrol agent with high efficiency and low mutation rates. Salmonella phages have confronted challenges to counteract with more than 2,500 serovars of Salmonella spp. and overcome the universality of antibiotics to different species, and thus, broad-host-range phages infecting Salmonella spp. are urgently required to realize precise poultry treatment or clinical therapy. First, phage STP4-a was screened to have a broad host range through bioinformatics analysis, and then the host range assay proved that phage STP4-a could inhibit 88 out of 91 Salmonella strains. Then, in silico analysis excluded the possibility of phage STP4-a possessing any known lysogeny factors, toxins, pathogen-related genes, or foodborne allergens, and oral toxicity studies further ensured the safety of unknown factors or suspected risks. In addition, strong inhibition effects of phage STP4-a were seen on both single Salmonella strain and multiple Salmonella strains in~vitro, reducing 3-5 log in 30~min. Phage STP4-a could survive and keep more than 50\% activity in simulated stomach or intestine environments in vitro. In terms of antimicrobial activities in chickens, pretreatment with phage STP4-a was the most efficient approach to Salmonella biocontrol, non-detectable in feces during the 14-day experimental period. Therefore, phage STP4-a was an extremely broad-host-range and safe biocontrol agent, performing its potential as a food additive or therapeutic drug in poultry industry.},

In this study, a novel Salmonella phage, vB\_SalS\_JNS02, was isolated successfully from poultry farms in Shandong, China. The biological characteristics of vB\_SalS\_JNS02 were analysed, which revealed a short latent period of approximately 10 min and a burst size of 110 PFU/cell. Moreover, vB\_SalS\_JNS02 exhibited remarkable stability across a wide pH range (pH 3-12) and temperatures ranging from 30 to 80°C. Genome sequencing analysis provided valuable insights into the genetic composition of vB\_SalS\_JNS02, which consists of a double-stranded DNA genome that spans 42,450 base pairs and has a G + C content of 49.4\%. Of significant importance, the genomic sequence of vB\_SalS\_JNS02 did not contain any genes related to lysogenicity, virulence, or antibiotic resistance. The phage's efficacy was evaluated in a larval challenge study. Treatment with the phage resulted in increased survival of Galleria mellonella larvae (100, 70, and 85\%) (MOI 0.1) in the prophylactic treatment, co-infection treatment, and remedial treatment experiments, respectively. Another in vivo experiment investigated the potential application of the phage in broiler chickens and revealed that a single oral dose of vB\_SalS\_JNS02 (108 PFU/mL, 100 µL/chick) administered 3 h after S. enteritidis oral administration provided effective protection. The introduction of bacteriophage not only enhances the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), but also induces alterations in the composition of the gut microbial community. Phage therapy increases the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, which helps to maintain intestinal barrier homeostasis. However, it is unable to fully restore the disrupted intestinal microbiome caused by S. enteritidis infection. Importantly, no significant adverse effects were observed in the animal subjects following oral administration of the phage, and our findings highlight vB\_SalS\_JNS02 is a hopeful candidate as a promising tool to target Salmonella infections in poultry.},

  abstract = {Emergence of antibiotic resistance presents a major setback to global health, and shortage of antibiotic pipelines has created an urgent need for development of alternative therapeutic strategies. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is considered as a potential approach for treatment of the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS) refers to sublethal concentrations of certain antibiotics that enhance release of progeny phages from bacterial cells. A combination of phages and antibiotics is a promising strategy to reduce the dose of antibiotics and the development of antibiotic resistance during treatment. In this review, we highlight the state-of-the-art advancements of PAS studies, including the analysis of bacterial-killing enhancement, bacterial resistance reduction, and anti-biofilm effect, at both in vitro and in vivo levels. A comprehensive review of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of phage antibiotic synergy is provided, and synthetic biology approaches used to engineer phages, and design novel therapies and diagnostic tools are discussed. In addition, the role of engineered phages in reducing pathogenicity of bacteria is explored.},

How               Salmonella               Enteritidis rapidly swept through continents remains a historical puzzle as the pathogen continues to cause outbreaks and poultry supply becomes globalized. We hypothesize that international trade of infected breeding stocks causes global spread of the pathogen. By integrating over 30,000               Salmonella               Enteritidis genomes from 98 countries during 1949–2020 and international trade of live poultry from the 1980s to the late 2010s, we present multifaceted evidence that converges on a high likelihood, global scale, and extended protraction of               Salmonella               Enteritidis dissemination via centralized sourcing and international trade of breeding stocks. We discovered recent, genetically near-identical isolates from domestically raised poultry in North and South America. We obtained phylodynamic characteristics of global               Salmonella               Enteritidis populations that lend spatiotemporal support for its dispersal from centralized origins during the pandemic. We identified concordant patterns of international trade of breeding stocks and quantitatively established a driving role of the trade in the geographic dispersal of               Salmonella               Enteritidis, suggesting that the centralized origins were infected breeding stocks. Here we demonstrate the value of integrative and hypothesis-driven data mining in unravelling otherwise difficult-to-probe pathogen dissemination from hidden origins.},

  abstract = {Oviductal inflammation (OI) significantly reduces the egg production and economic returns in poultry farming. While Lactobacillus crispatus (LAC) is effective against inflammation, its role in treating or preventing oviductal inflammation is understudied. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of LAC on oviductal inflammation, with a focus on reproductive tract health, microbiome, gene expression, and cytokine levels. This study involved 24 Jingfen No. 6 laying hens aged 60 weeks, divided into four groups: the CON, OI, OI + LAC, and OI + heat-killed Lactobacillus crispatus (HLAC) groups. And it included a 10-day adaptation, a 7-day period for the development of OI using inflammation-inducing drugs (the control received saline), followed by an 8-day treatment in which the CON and OI groups received 1 mL of MRS broth daily, and the OI + LAC and OI + HLAC groups were treated with live and heat-killed Lactobacillus crispatus (109 CFUs/mL), respectively, with six hens in each group. This study showed that Lactobacillus crispatus supplementation significantly reduced the oviductal inflammation and atrophy in the hens, with the affected hens showing markedly lower egg production rates (p {$<$} 0.001) compared to the control and treated groups (OI + HLAC and OI + LAC). The daily intake of fresh (OI + LAC, p = 0.076) or heat-killed (OI + HLAC, p {$<$} 0.01) Lactobacillus crispatus notably enhanced the feed conversion efficiency. The OI group suffered significant ovarian damage and vascular rupture, more so than the CON group, while Lactobacillus crispatus supplementation mitigated this damage. The IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 levels were significantly elevated in the OI group compared to those in the OI + LAC group (p {$<$} 0.05), with a significant reduction in the TNF-α levels in the latter (p {$<$} 0.001). The supplementation improved the microbial composition in the cecum, isthmus, and shell gland, enriching the cecum with beneficial bacteria, such as Ruminococcus\_torques\_group and Megamonas. This approach fostered ovarian health and follicle differentiation and preserved the epithelial cell barrier function in the shell gland, reducing inflammatory damage in the genital tract. This dual efficacy underscores the role of the probiotic in diminishing oviductal inflammation, regardless of its state.},

Our results showed that geese reared in an outdoor system had significantly lower serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared to those reared indoors, but lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and higher levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Moreover, the cecal microbiota of geese reared outdoors exhibited higher species evenness and increased alpha diversity, with a significant alteration in the F/B ratios. The bacterial taxonomy composition also differed between the 2 rearing systems, with higher relative abundances of the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and lower relative abundances of the Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the outdoor system. These findings suggest that rearing systems may play a critical role in shaping the gut microbiome and overall health of geese. Notably, our data demonstrated that indoor rearing was associated with a higher abundance of pathogenic genera and a lower abundance of commensal genera compared to outdoor rearing. Our study supports the hypothesis that rearing systems may alter the physiological functions and microbial composition of geese, and highlights the need for further research to confirm and expand upon these findings. In summary, our study underscores the importance of considering the impact of rearing systems on the gut microbiome and health of geese.},

  abstract = {The practice of phage therapy, which uses bacterial viruses (phages) to treat bacterial infections, has been around for almost a century. The universal decline in the effectiveness of antibiotics has generated renewed interest in revisiting this practice. Conventionally, phage therapy relies on the use of naturally-occurring phages to infect and lyse bacteria at the site of infection. Biotechnological advances have further expanded the repertoire of potential phage therapeutics to include novel strategies using bioengineered phages and purified phage lytic proteins. Current research on the use of phages and their lytic proteins, specifically against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, suggests phage therapy has the potential to be used as either an alternative or a supplement to antibiotic treatments. Antibacterial therapies, whether phage- or antibiotic-based, each have relative advantages and disadvantages; accordingly, many considerations must be taken into account when designing novel therapeutic approaches for preventing and treating bacterial infections. Although much is still unknown about the interactions between phage, bacteria, and human host, the time to take phage therapy seriously seems to be rapidly approaching.},

The goal of this commentary is to discuss many of those issues in a single location. In terms of “Pros,” for example, phages can be bactericidal, can increase in number over the course of treatment, tend to only minimally disrupt normal flora, are equally effective against antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, often are easily discovered, seem to be capable of disrupting bacterial biofilms, and can have low inherent toxicities. In addition to these assets, we consider aspects of phage therapy that can contribute to its safety, economics, or convenience, but in ways that are perhaps less essential to the phage potential to combat bacteria. For example, autonomous phage transfer between animals during veterinary application could provide convenience or economic advantages by decreasing the need for repeated phage application, but is not necessarily crucial to therapeutic success. We also consider possible disadvantages to phage use as antibacterial agents. These “Cons,” however, tend to be relatively minor.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages selectively infect and kill their target bacterial host, being a promising approach to controlling zoonotic bacteria in poultry production. To ensure confidence in its use, fundamental questions of safety and toxicity monitoring of phage therapy should be raised. Due to its high specificity, a minimal impact on the gut ecology is expected; however, more in-depth research into key parameters that influence the success of phage interventions has been needed to reach a consensus on the impact of bacteriophage therapy in the gut. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the interaction of phages with animals; more specifically, we compared the caecum microbiome and metabolome after a               Salmonella               phage challenge in               Salmonella               -free broilers, evaluating the role of the phage administration route. To this end, we employed 45 caecum content samples from a previous study where               Salmonella               phages were administered               via               drinking water or feed for 24~h from 4, 5 to 6-weeks-old broilers. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed a high level of similarity (beta diversity) but revealed a significant change in alpha diversity between broilers with               Salmonella               -phage administered in the drinking water and control. Our results showed that the phages affected only a few genera of the microbiota’s structure, regardless of the administration route. Among these, we found a significant increase in               Streptococcus               and               Sellimonas               in the drinking water and               Lactobacillus               ,               Anaeroplasma               and               Clostridia\_vadinBB60\_group               in the feed. Nevertheless, the LC-HRMS-based metabolomics analyses revealed that despite few genera were significantly affected, a substantial number of metabolites, especially in the phage administered in the drinking water were significantly altered (64 and 14 in the drinking water and feed groups, respectively). Overall, our study shows that preventive therapy with bacteriophages minimally alters the caecal microbiota but significantly impacts their metabolites, regardless of the route of administration.},

Nevertheless, changes in gastrointestinal tract environmental conditions throughout the production cycle could compromise the efficacy of phages administered orally. The main objectives of this study were to assess the optimal timing of the phage administration over a 42-day production cycle and to compare microencapsulated and non-encapsulated phages and the spatial and temporal dynamics of the phage delivery along the gastrointestinal tract. Phage FGS011 was encapsulated in the pH-responsive polymer Eudragit® L100 using the process of spray drying. At different weeks of the chicken rearing period, 15 broilers were divided into three groups. Over a period of 24 h, group 1 received non-encapsulated phages (delivered through drinking water), group 2 received microencapsulated phages (incorporated in animal feed), and group 3 did not receive any phages. Microencapsulation was shown to enable efficient delivery of the bacteriophages to the animal gut and cecum throughout the animal rearing period. During the six weeks of application, the crop displayed the highest phage concentration for both phage delivery methods. The L100 based encapsulation offered significant protection to the phages from the harsh environmental conditions in the PV-Gizzard (not seen with phages administered in drinking water) which may help in the delivery of high phage doses to the cecum. Future Salmonella challenge studies are necessary to demonstrate the benefits of microencapsulation of phages using L100 formulation on phage therapy in field studies during the rearing period.},

One-hundred one-day-old chicks were randomly divided in two identical poultry houses according to the two experimental groups (control vs Φ-treated group) simulating field production conditions. Half of the animals in each experimental group, were challenged with 105 CFU/bird of Salmonella Enteritidis per os. In the Φ-treated group, microencapsulated Salmonella-phage encapsulated in Eudragit®L100 (a pH-responsive formulation) were incorporated in the starter diet feed. To assess Salmonella colonization, excretion and diffusion, cecum samples, cloacal swabs and boot swabs were taken weekly. Salmonella detection was based on ISO 6579-1:2017 (Annex D). Salmonella colonization was significantly reduced in most of the rearing period, meanwhile the excretion was significantly reduced on the 2nd, 4th and 5th week of rearing. Moreover, Salmonella contamination of the farm environment was eliminated at the end of the cycle.

This study investigated the influence of Salmonella phage on host physiology through caecal microbiota and metabolome modulation using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and an untargeted metabolomics approach. We employed 24 caecum content samples and 24 blood serum samples from 4-, 5- and 6-week-old broilers from a previous study where Salmonella phages were administered via feed in Salmonella-infected broilers, which were individually weighed weekly. Phage therapy did not affect the alpha or beta diversity of the microbiota. Specifically, we observed changes in the relative abundance of 14 out of the 110 genera using the PLS-DA and Bayes approaches. On the other hand, we noted changes in the caecal metabolites (63 up-accumulated and 37 down-accumulated out of the 1113 caecal metabolites). Nevertheless, the minimal changes in blood serum suggest a non-significant physiological response. The application of Salmonella phages under production conditions modulates the caecal microbiome and metabolome profiles in broilers without impacting the host physiology in terms of growth performance.},

  abstract = {The therapeutic use of bacteriophages is recognized as a viable method to control Salmonella. Microencapsulation of phages in oral dosage forms may protect phages from inherent challenges of the gastrointestinal tract in chickens. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the survival of Salmonella BP FGS011 (non-encapsulated and microencapsulated) through the gastrointestinal tract under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions after oral administration to 1-day-old chicks. To this end, the phage FGS011 was encapsulated in two different pH-responsive formulations with polymers Eudragit® L100, and Eudragit® S100 using the process of spray drying. Phages encapsulated in either of the two formulations were able to survive exposure to the proventriculus-gizzard in vitro conditions whereas free phages did not. Moreover, phages formulated in polymer Eudragit® S100 would be better suited to deliver phage to the caeca in chickens. In the in vivo assay, no statistically significant differences were observed in the phage concentrations across the gastrointestinal tract for either the free phage or the encapsulated phage given to chicks. This suggested that the pH of the proventriculus/gizzard in young chicks is not sufficiently acidic to cause differential phage titre reductions, thereby allowing free phage survival in vivo.},

Bacteria can easily form biofilms to improve their survival, which reduces the efficacy of antibacterial drugs. Proteins such as endolysins and holins have been shown to have good antibacterial activity and effectively removal bacterial biofilms and reduce the production of drug-resistant bacteria. Recently, phages and their encoded lytic proteins have attracted attention as potential alternative antimicrobial agents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the sterilising efficacy of phages (SSE1, SGF2, and SGF3) and their encoded lytic proteins (lysozyme and holin), and to further explore their potential in combination with antibiotics. To the ultimate aim is to reduce or replace the use of antibiotics and provide more materials and options for sterilisation.},

The ability of strains to form biofilms, which is a multicellular behavior characterized by the aggregation of cells, is predicted to be a conserved strategy for increased persistence and survival. It may also contribute to the increasing number of infections caused by ingestion of contaminated fruits and vegetables. There is a correlation between biofilm formation and the ability of strains to colonize and replicate within the intestines of multiple host species. These strains predominantly cause localized gastroenteritis infections in humans. In contrast, there are salmonellae that cause systemic, disseminated infections in a select few host species; these “invasive” strains have a narrowed host range, and most are unable to form biofilms. This includes host-restricted {$<$}italic{$>$}Salmonella{$<$}/italic{$>$} serovar Typhi, which are only able to infect humans, and atypical gastroenteritis strains associated with the opportunistic infection of immunocompromised patients. From the perspective of transmission, biofilm formation is advantageous for ensuring pathogen survival in the environment. However, from an infection point of view, biofilm formation may be an anti-virulence trait. We do not know if the capacity to form biofilms prevents a strain from accessing the systemic compartments within the host or if loss of the biofilm phenotype reflects a change in a strain’s interaction with the host. In this review, we examine the connections between biofilm formation, {$<$}italic{$>$}Salmonella{$<$}/italic{$>$} disease states, degrees of host adaptation, and how this might relate to different transmission patterns.

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, the viruses infecting bacteria, hold great potential for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and other applications due to their unparalleled diversity and recent breakthroughs in their genetic engineering. However, fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying phage–host interactions is mostly confined to a few traditional model systems and did not keep pace with the recent massive expansion of the field. The true potential of molecular biology encoded by these viruses has therefore remained largely untapped, and phages for therapy or other applications are often still selected empirically. We therefore sought to promote a systematic exploration of phage–host interactions by composing a well-assorted library of 68 newly isolated phages infecting the model organism Escherichia coli that we share with the community as the BASEL (BActeriophage SElection for your Laboratory) collection. This collection is largely representative of natural E. coli phage diversity and was intensively characterized phenotypically and genomically alongside 10 well-studied traditional model phages. We experimentally determined essential host receptors of all phages, quantified their sensitivity to 11 defense systems across different layers of bacterial immunity, and matched these results to the phages’ host range across a panel of pathogenic enterobacterial strains. Clear patterns in the distribution of phage phenotypes and genomic features highlighted systematic differences in the potency of different immunity systems and suggested the molecular basis of receptor specificity in several phage groups. Our results also indicate strong trade-offs between fitness traits like broad host recognition and resistance to bacterial immunity that might drive the divergent adaptation of different phage groups to specific ecological niches. We envision that the BASEL collection will inspire future work exploring the biology of bacteriophages and their hosts by facilitating the discovery of underlying molecular mechanisms as the basis for an effective translation into biotechnology or therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Phages are the most diversified and dominant members of the gut virobiota. They play a crucial role in shaping the structure and function of the gut microbial community and consequently the health of humans and animals. Phages are found mainly in the mucus, from where they can translocate to the intestinal organs and act as a modulator of gut microbiota. Understanding the vital role of phages in regulating the composition of intestinal microbiota and influencing human and animal health is an emerging area of research. The relevance of phages in the gut ecosystem is supported by substantial evidence, but the importance of phages in shaping the gut microbiota remains unclear. Although information regarding general phage ecology and development has accumulated, detailed knowledge on phage-gut microbe and phage-human interactions is lacking, and the information on the effects of phage therapy in humans remains ambiguous. In this review, we systematically assess the existing data on the structure and ecology of phages in the human and animal gut environments, their development, possible interaction, and subsequent impact on the gut ecosystem dynamics. We discuss the potential mechanisms of prophage activation and the subsequent modulation of gut bacteria. We also review the link between phages and the immune system to collect evidence on the effect of phages on shaping the gut microbial composition. Our review will improve understanding on the influence of phages in regulating the gut microbiota and the immune system and facilitate the development of phage-based therapies for maintaining a healthy and balanced gut microbiota.},

  abstract = {Exploiting the potential of bacteriophages for phage therapy is an exciting future prospect. However, in order to be successful, there is a pressing need for the manufacture of safe and efficacious phage drug products to treat patients. Scalable manufacture of phage biologics as a stable solid dry powder form is highly desirable and achievable using the process of spray drying. Spray drying of purified phage suspensions formulated with suitable excipients can be carried out in a single step with high process throughput and at relatively low cost. The resulting phage-containing powders can possess good storage shelf-life. The process allows control over the final phage dose in the powder and production of microparticles suitable for a variety of therapeutic uses. Spray dried powders may include different polymer formulations employing a multitude of different triggers for phage release at the target site including pH, enzymes, virulence factors etc. The activity of the phages in spray dried powders is adversely affected during spray drying due to dessication and thermal stresses which need to be controlled. The choice of polymers, excipients and moisture content of the dry powders affects the material glass transition temperature and the stability of the phages during storage. The storage temperature and storage humidty are important factors affecting the stability of the phages in the dry powders. A quality by design (QbD) approach for phage drug product development needs to identify drug product characteristics that are critical to quality from the patient's perspective and translates them into the critical quality attributes (CQA) of the drug product. The relationship between the phage drug product CQAs and formulation development and spray drying process conditions are discussed in this article.},

  abstract = {Phage therapy is a promising treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections but is limited by the narrow host range of phage. To overcome this limitation, we developed a host range expansion (HRE) protocol that expands the host range of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-specific phage by cycles of co-incubation of phage with multiple P. aeruginosa strains. Application of the HRE protocol to a mixture of 4 phages, using 16 P. aeruginosa strains for development, resulted in undefined phage mixtures with greatly expanded host range. Individual phage clones derived from the undefined mixture had expanded host ranges but no individual clone could lyse all of the strains covered by the undefined mixture from which it was isolated. Reconstituting host range-characterized clones into cocktails produced defined cocktails with predictable and broad host ranges. The undefined mixture from the 30th cycle of the mixed-phage HRE (4ϕC30) showed a dose-dependent ability to prevent biofilm formation by, and to reduce a pre-existing biofilm of, 3 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates that produced high amounts of biofilm. A defined cocktail reconstituted from 3 host range-characterized clones had activity on high biofilm-formers susceptible to the phage. Phage therapy was superior to antibiotic therapy (levofloxacin) in a strain of P. aeruginosa that was resistant to levofloxacin. The HRE protocol establishes a rapid approach to create libraries of phage clones and phage cocktails with broad host range, defined composition and anti-biofilm activity.},

Likewise, molecular studies of bacteriophage have centered on understanding mechanisms by which bacteriophage exploit the intracellular environment of their bacterial hosts. These binary interactions~– bacteriophage infect bacteria and bacteria infect eukaryotic hosts~– have remained largely separate lines of inquiry. However, recent evidence demonstrates how tripartite interactions between bacteriophage, bacteria and the eukaryotic host shape the dynamics and fate of each component. In this perspective, we provide an overview of different ways in which bacteriophage ecology modulates bacterial infections along a spectrum of positive to negative impacts on a mammalian host. We also examine how coevolutionary processes over longer timescales may change the valence of these interactions. We argue that anticipating both ecological and evolutionary dynamics is key to understand and control tripartite interactions and ultimately to the success or failure of phage therapy., Immunology; Virology; Bacteriology; Evolutionary ecology.},

  abstract = {Non-Typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) is one of the most common food-borne pathogens worldwide, with poultry products being the major vehicle for pathogenesis in humans. The use of bacteriophage (phage) cocktails has recently emerged as a novel approach to enhancing food safety. Here, a multireceptor Salmonella phage cocktail of five phages was developed and characterized. The cocktail targets four receptors: O-antigen, BtuB, OmpC, and rough Salmonella strains. Structural analysis indicated that all five phages belong to unique families or subfamilies. Genome analysis of four of the phages showed they were devoid of known virulence or antimicrobial resistance factors, indicating enhanced safety. The phage cocktail broad antimicrobial spectrum against Salmonella, significantly inhibiting the growth of all 66 strains from 20 serovars tested in vitro. The average bacteriophage insensitive mutant (BIM) frequency against the cocktail was 6.22 × 10−6 in S. Enteritidis, significantly lower than that of each of the individual phages. The phage cocktail reduced the load of Salmonella in inoculated chicken skin by 3.5 log10 CFU/cm2 after 48 h at 25°C and 15°C, and 2.5 log10 CFU/cm2 at 4°C. A genome-wide transduction assay was used to investigate the transduction efficiency of the selected phage in the cocktail. Only one of the four phages tested could transduce the kanamycin resistance cassette at a low frequency comparable to that of phage P22. Overall, the results support the potential of cocktails of phage that each target different host receptors to achieve complementary infection and reduce the emergence of phage resistance during biocontrol applications.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and are present in niches where bacteria thrive. In recent years, the suggested application areas of lytic bacteriophage have been expanded to include therapy, biocontrol, detection, sanitation, and remediation. However, phage application is constrained by the phage’s host range—the range of bacterial hosts sensitive to the phage and the degree of infection. Even though phage isolation and enrichment techniques are straightforward protocols, the correlation between the enrichment technique and host range profile has not been evaluated. Agar-based methods such as spotting assay and efficiency of plaquing (EOP) are the most used methods to determine the phage host range. These methods, aside from being labor intensive, can lead to subjective and incomplete results as they rely on qualitative observations of the lysis/plaques, do not reflect the lytic activity in liquid culture, and can overestimate the host range. In this study, phages against three bacterial genera were isolated using three different enrichment methods. Host range profiles of the isolated phages were quantitatively determined using a high throughput turbidimetric protocol and the data were analyzed with an accessible analytic tool “PHIDA”. Using this tool, the host ranges of 9 Listeria, 14 Salmonella, and 20 Pseudomonas phages isolated with different enrichment methods were quantitatively compared. A high variability in the host range index (HRi) ranging from 0.86–0.63, 0.07–0.24, and 0.00–0.67 for Listeria, Salmonella, and Pseudomonas phages, respectively, was observed. Overall, no direct correlation was found between the phage host range breadth and the enrichment method in any of the three target bacterial genera. The high throughput method and analytics tool developed in this study can be easily adapted to any phage study and can provide a consensus for phage host range determination.},

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to determine the degree of colistin-driven modulation of inflammatory response in blood of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged healthy volunteers in a human endotoxemia model. After a single intravenous dose of 2.5 million IU colistin methanesulfonate, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and IL-1β concentrations as well as other biomarkers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, differential leukocyte counts, and body temperature were measured up to 24 h postdose. Colistin significantly decreased the inflammatory cytokine response to LPS in blood of healthy volunteers. This effect was most evident for IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. This study is the first to confirm the anti-endotoxin effect of colistin in humans in vivo. Further studies might increase our knowledge on the interaction between colistin and the effectors of the immune system.},

  abstract = {Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) constitutes ongoing health concerns for women, newborns, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals due to increased numbers of urinary tract infections (UTIs), newborn meningitis, abdominal sepsis, and septicemia. E. coli remains the leading cause of UTIs, with recent investigations reporting the emergence of E. coli as the predominant cause of nosocomial and neonatal sepsis infections. This shift from the traditional Gram-positive bacterial causes of nosocomial and neonatal sepsis infections could be attributed to the use of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis against Gram-positive bacteria and the appearance of antibiotic (ATB) resistance in E. coli. While ExPEC strains cause significant healthcare concerns, these bacteria also infect chickens and cause the poultry industry economic losses due to costs of containment, mortality, and disposal of carcasses. To circumvent ExPEC-related costs, ATBs are commonly used in the poultry industry to prevent/treat microbial infections and promote growth and performance. In an unfortunate linkage, chicken products are suspected to be a source of foodborne ExPEC infections and ATB resistance in humans. Therefore, the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) (resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobial agents) among avian E. coli has created major economic and health concerns, affecting both human healthcare and poultry industries. Increased numbers of immunocompromised individuals, including the elderly, coupled with MDR among ExPEC strains, will continue to challenge the treatment of ExPEC infections and likely lead to increased treatment costs. With ongoing complications due to emerging ATB resistance, novel treatment strategies are necessary to control ExPEC infections. Recognizing and treating the zoonotic risk posed by ExPEC would greatly enhance food safety and positively impact human health.},

However, little is known about the parameters that can influence the efficacy of phages on biofilms. This systematic review provides a summary and analysis of the published data about the use of phages to control pre-formed biofilms in vitro, suggesting recommendations for future experiments in this area. A total of 68 articles, containing data on 605 experiments addressing the efficacy of phages to control biofilms in vitro were included, after a search conducted in Web of Science, Embase, and Medline (PubMed). The data collected from each experiment included information about biofilm growth conditions, phage characteristics, treatment conditions and biofilm reduction. In most cases, biofilms were formed in the surface of microtiter plates (82.5\%); the median time for biofilm formation was 24~h, as is the median treatment duration. Quantification of biofilm biomass (52.6\%), viable cells (25.5\%) and metabolic activity (17.9\%) were the most common biofilm assessment methods. Correlation analysis revealed that some phage parameters can influence the treatment outcome: higher phage concentrations were strongly associated with improved biofilm control, leading to higher levels of biofilm reduction, and phages with higher burst sizes and shorter latent periods seem to be the best candidates to control biofilms in vitro. However, the great variability of the methodologies used prompts the need for the development of standardized in vitro methodologies to characterize phage/biofilm interactions and to assess the efficacy of phages to control biofilms.},

Significant (               p               ≤ 0.05) increases in                                pro-inflammatory cytokines                              -interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-16, and IL-21;                                anti-inflammatory cytokines                              - IL-10;                                chemokines                              -regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), and MIP-3α;                                colony stimulating factors                              -macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF); and                                growth factors                              -vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were observed in the serum of the challenged chicks when compared to the control. No significant differences were observed in IL-2, interferon gamma (IFNγ), and IFNα. These data indicate the detection of mucosal immune responses in broiler chickens following ST infection. The heightened levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and colony stimulating factors align with known inflammatory mechanisms, like the influx of immune cells. However, the elevation of IL-10 was unexpected, due to its immunoregulatory properties. Notably, the rise in VEGF levels is compelling, as it suggests the possibility of tissue repair and angiogenesis in ST infected birds.},

These inflammatory cells produce cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN- γ, IL-1, etc. Ciprofloxacin is the last drug of choice to clear the infection. Ciprofloxacin, a grace inhibitor, kills bacteria by inducing chromosome fragmentation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the bacterial cell. This study was designed to investigate the ability of Salmonella typhimiurm to induce TNF-α in cells. 30 NMRI mice from both genders were divided randomly into 3 groups (n=10) and treated as follows: The first group was intraperitoneally (I.P.) injected with a 0.1 ml/4×108 CFU/ ml bacterial suspension of S. typhimiurm as a positive control. The second group was injected (I.P.) with S. typhimiurm 0.1 ml (4×108 CFU/ml and then injected with 30 mg/kg/0.3 ml of CiprofloxacinCiprofloxacin intramuscular (I.M.). The olive leaf alcoholic extract was given to the third group through a gavage tube for two weeks before giving I/P 0.1 ml/4×108 CFU/ml S. typhimiurm. Afterward, they were post-treated with 30 mg/kg/0.3 ml of olive leaf extract orally by gavage tube until the end of the experiment (30 days). The recorded data from group 1 showed heavy deposition of TNF-α marker in the spleen and liver, and examination showed dark brown cellular components. Also, in the second group, the spleen and liver tissue sections showed heavy deposition of TNF-α marker; other sections showed moderated deposition of TNF-α marker. In the third group, TNF marker was found in small amounts or not in tissue samples from the spleen and liver. Histopathological examination of infected 1st group liver and spleen tissue sections shows lobular hepatic necrosis with mononuclear cells. Aggregation manifests as granuloma lesions, particularly lymphocytes in the portal area around the bile duct and blood vessels, with the proliferation of macrophages known as kupffer cells and depletion of white pulp in spleen tissue when compared to the second and third groups, which demonstrated moderated lesions in infected and treated mice. The results showed that olive leaf extract reduces the infection of Salmonella typhimiurm in the pre and post-treated groups better than CiprofloxacinCiprofloxacin.},

As an alternative or supplement to antibiotics, bacteriophages can be used to circumvent the resistance to existing antibiotics. The aim of this study was to assess the synergistic effect of a naturally isolated phage and ampicillin against Escherichia coli O157. Materials and Methods: In the present study, a natural phage against E. coli O157 was isolated, the morphology and molecular characteristics of the phage were identified, and the combination of bacteriophage and antibiotic to combat clinically isolated drug-resistant E. coli O157 was evaluated.  Results: The results showed the synergistic action between a naturally isolated phage and ampicillin in solid (disk diffusion test) and liquid culture media. Addition of the isolated phage, gT0E.co-MGY2, to the microbial lawn of bacteria in modified antibiotic disk diffusion test, altered susceptibility pattern of E. coli O157 from resistant to sensitive based on the inhibition zones. Combinations of bacteriophage and ampicillin significantly enhanced the killing of bacterial strains when compared to treatment with ampicillin or phage alone in liquid culture. Moreover, it lasted few hours for ampicillin to reverse the growth of E. coli O157, while the bacteriophage and combination treatment stopped the proliferation of bacteria from the beginning, and this can compensate the delayed onset of antibiotic action. Conclusion: The synergistic action of bacteriophages and antibiotics is an alternative that cannot only be effective against bacterial infections but also contribute to the reduction of antibiotic resistance.},

In this sense, this research evaluates the viability of lyophilized vibrio phage vB\_Pd\_PDCC-1 using trehalose as a preservative excipient at different concentrations (4, 2, 1, and 0.5\% w/v) and its potential for phage therapy application against a pathogenic bacteria Vibrio diabolicus in brine shrimp nauplii (Artemia franciscana). The lyophilized phages were stored at 4 and 23~°C and rehydrated using biological sterile saline solution to test their viability at days 1, 15, and 60 post-lyophilization. The results showed that trehalose is beneficial in maintaining the viability of post-lyophilization phages (without titer losses) at 4~°C and even at room temperature (23~°C). When lyophilized phages with 4\% w/v trehalose concentration were stored at 23~°C, they had not titer losses among the trials; viability and titer concentration were maintained up to 60~days at log 7. The use of lyophilized phage PDCC-1 increased brine shrimp survival and reduced Vibrio concentrations. The present study has identified trehalose as a promising lyophilization excipient to effectively preserve lyophilized bacteriophages for biotechnological applications and long-term storage.},

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has sparked a renewed interest in alternative bacterial control methods, including bacteriophage administration. In order to determine the overall efficacy of bacteriophage administration for the reduction of bacterial concentrations in poultry, a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were conducted. The systematic review included studies in which 1) live chickens were challenged with a known quantity of bacteria; and 2) challenged chickens were administered a known quantity of bacteriophages; and 3) concentrations of the challenge bacteria were measured in tissue/fluid samples from both challenged and unchallenged chickens after phage administration; and 4) either standard deviation or standard error was reported. Results of a meta-analysis of the 12 studies included in this review (total inputs: n~=~41; total observations: n~=~711) indicated that concentrations of challenge bacteria were significantly lower (P {$<$} 0.001) in challenged, phage-treated chickens than in challenged, untreated chickens (effect size~=~-0.82 log10 cfu/g). Phage treatment effects were significantly greater (P {$<$} 0.01) in chickens administered phages via feed than in chickens administered phages via drinking water or aerosol spray. No significant differences were observed between subgroups when data were disaggregated by various other experimental characteristics, though some significant differences were observed across subgroups after further disaggregation by sampling time and animal age. As a whole, findings from the systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that phage administration can significantly lower concentrations of targeted bacteria in chickens and that, in some instances, the effect may be greater in the short-term vs. the long-term and in older vs. younger chickens.},

  abstract = {• The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based molecular diagnostic kit for rapid diagnosis of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium serotypes, which are frequently isolated worldwide from poultry samples. • Detection and discrimination of S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium were performed by targeting the sdf and the STM4492 (putative cytoplasmic protein) gene, respectively. The invA (invasion protein) gene was used to detect Salmonella spp. as a target gene, since it is considered a standard. In this study, a total of 200 bacterial strains (178 Salmonella spp. strains and 22 other genera) were used to test the specificity and sensitivity of the developed kit. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assays was determined to be 10⁰-10¹ cfu/25g from chicken meat samples artificially contaminated by litter and 10⁰-10¹ cfu/ml for cloacal swab samples. • The multiplex qPCR results were 100\% compatible with conventional serotyping results while the specificity and sensitivity values were 100\%. These findings indicated that the newly developed multiplex qPCR technique can provide an alternative method to conventional serotyping of S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium in laboratories lacking adequate infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent stimulator of monocytes and macrophages, causing secretion of tumor necrosis factor ␣ (TNF-␣) and other inflammatory mediators. Given the deleterious effects to the host of TNF-␣, it has been postulated that TNF-␣ gene expression must be tightly regulated. The nature of the nuclear factor(s) that control TNF-␣ gene transcription in humans remains obscure, although NF-␬B has been suggested. Our previous studies pertaining to macrophage response to LPS identified a novel DNA-binding domain located from ؊550 to ؊487 in the human TNF-␣ promoter that contains transcriptional activity, but lacks any known NF-␬B-binding sites. We have used this DNA fragment to isolate and purify a 60-kDa protein binding to this fragment and obtained its aminoterminal sequence, which was used to design degenerate probes to screen a cDNA library from THP-1 cells. A novel cDNA clone (1.8 kb) was isolated and fully sequenced. Characterization of this cDNA clone revealed that its induction was dependent on LPS activation of THP-1 cells; hence, the name LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor (LITAF). Inhibition of LITAF mRNA expression in THP-1 cells resulted in a reduction of TNF-␣ transcripts. In addition, high level of expression of LITAF mRNA was observed predominantly in the placenta, peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph nodes, and the spleen. Finally, chromosomal localization using fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that LITAF mapped to chromosome 16p12–16p13.3. Together, these findings suggest that LITAF plays an important role in the activation of the human TNF-␣ gene and proposes a new mechanism to control TNF-␣ gene expression.},

S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis were selected from the isolated Salmonella to prepare bacteriophages from sewage water taken at broiler farms. An experimental infection of one day old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks followed by treatment with the prepared bacteriophages isolated from both Salmonella was performed. Caecal samples from infected chicks were subjected at intervals to bacteriophage isolation and Salmonella quantitation. The effectiveness of bacteriophage treatments on Salmonella colonization in cecum of infected chicks increased after five successive doses. At 3 day post infection (dpi), cecal contents showed a marginal decrease in Salmonella loads with more reduction at 5 dpi. From 7 dpi to the end of the experiment at 15 dpi, all the chicks were cleared for both Salmonella., The findings of this study demonstrate that bacteriophage treatment is efficacious in reducing S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis colonization in broiler chickens within a short period and could be used as an alternative to antibiotics.},

However, their isolation is a complicated challenge since their occurrence appears to be low. This work assessed the efficiency of seven protocols for recovering Campylobacter phages from chicken skin samples inoculated at phage loads from 5.0~×~101 to 5.0~×~106~PFU/g. The enrichment of chicken skin in selective Bolton broth containing target isolates was the most efficient procedure, showing a low detection limit of 5.0~×~101~PFU/g and high recovery rates of up to 560\%. This method's effectiveness increased as phage concentration decreased, showing its suitability for phage isolation. When this method was applied to isolate new Campylobacter phages from retail chicken skin, a total of 280 phages were recovered achieving an isolation success rate of 257\%. From the 109 samples 68 resulted phage positive (62\%). Chicken skin could be, therefore, considered a rich source in Campylobacter phages. This method is a simple, reproducible and efficient approach for the successful isolation of both group II and III Campylobacter specific bacteriophages, which could be helpful for the enhancement of food safety by reducing this pathogen contamination in broiler meat.},

Genome size characterization determined by PFGE classified these isolates,called CAM1-CAM304, within the campylophages group II (n~=~18) and group III (n~=~286). Host range analyses showed a high host specificity and similar lytic spectrum among isolates of the same group. Campylophages of group II infected C. jejuni, C. coli and even a C. fetus strain whereas those of group III only infected C. jejuni strains. The most promising 59 campylophage candidates were selected according to their lytic activity and their genetic diversity was analyzed by RFLP using SmiI and HhaI endonucleases for group II and III campylophages, respectively. Moreover, RAPD-PCR technique was for the first time assessed in the genetic characterization of campylophages and it was shown to be effective only for those of group II. Bacteriophage isolates grouped in a same genotype displayed different host ranges, therefore, 13 campylophages of group II and eight of group III were differentiated considering all the approaches assayed. An in-depth analysis of these bacteriophages will be performed to confirm their promising potential for the biocontrol of Campylobacter within the farm to fork process.},

  abstract = {Anti-phage activity of serum is of importance in repeated phage therapy. Higher serum anti-phage activity has been associated with greater susceptibility of phages to neutralisation and phage therapy failure. In this study, in vivo and in vitro survivability and immunogenicity of four coliphages (TM1, TM2, TM3 and TM4) were investigated in naive chickens and chickens pre-immunised with phage TM1. Furthermore, two phages that displayed different survivability and immunogenicity (TM1 and TM3) were compared with respect to their efficacy in treating naive or pre-immunised (TM1) chickens suffering from colibacillosis. The efficacy of the treatments was evaluated based on body weight, relative organ weights, mortality, E. coli counts in the lungs as well as severity and frequency of internal organ lesions. At the end of the experiment, both naive and pre-immunised chickens treated with TM3 showed significantly lower mortality and higher body weights than untreated chickens and those treated with TM1. The same trend was observed in incidence and severity of organ lesions as well as relative spleen weight. However, naive chickens treated with TM1 also showed a shortened inflammation period as indicated by spleen weights. E. coli counts in the lungs of chicken treated with TM3 were lower than those of chickens treated with TM1 on days 3 and 10 post challenge. These data indicate that the outcome of phage therapy and the impact of serum anti-phage activity are highly phage-type dependent in broilers.},

  abstract = {Salmonella spp. is a leading cause of gastrointestinal enteritis in humans where it is largely contracted via contaminated poultry and pork. Phages can be used to control Salmonella infection in the animals, which could break the cycle of infection before the products are accessible for consumption. Here, the potential of 21 myoviruses and a siphovirus to eliminate Salmonella in vitro and in vivo was examined with the aim of developing a biocontrol strategy to curtail the infection in poultry and swine. Together, the phages targeted the twenty-three poultry and ten swine prevalent Salmonella serotype isolates tested. Although individual phages significantly reduced bacterial growth of representative isolates within 6 h post-infection, bacterial regrowth occurred 1 h later, indicating proliferation of resistant strains. To curtail bacteriophage resistance, a novel three-phage cocktail was developed in vitro, and further investigated in an optimized Galleria mellonella larva Salmonella infection model colonized with representative swine, chicken and laboratory strains. For all the strains examined, G. mellonella larvae given phages 2 h prior to bacterial exposure (prophylactic regimen) survived and Salmonella was undetectable 24 h post-phage treatment and throughout the experimental time (72 h). Administering phages with bacteria (co-infection), or 2 h post-bacterial exposure (remedial regimen) also improved survival (73–100\% and 15–88\%, respectively), but was less effective than prophylaxis application. These pre-livestock data support the future application of this cocktail for further development to effectively treat Salmonella infection in poultry and pigs. Future work will focus on cocktail formulation to ensure stability and incorporation into feeds and used to treat the infection in target animals.},

Although they possess several capabilities of practical utility in medicine, they are still unable to satisfy the regulatory standards set by the regulatory authorities in both United States (US) and European Union (EU). Bacteriophages and their products (lysins) are considered as drugs, therefore they should follow the same route of the chemical drugs in order to achieve regulatory approvals for commercial production and application. However, lack of definitive guidelines and regulations has rendered bacteriophages less attractive to pharmaceutical companies and funding agencies, making it difficult for clinicians and researchers to set up wide scale clinical trials in order to prove efficacy, safety and stability of bacteriophages and their products. In this review, we will discuss the current regulations for developing phages and phage-based products for therapeutic purposes in the US and EU. (www.actabiomedica.it)},

  abstract = {Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes colibacillosis, the main bacterial disease in poultry leading to significant economic losses worldwide. Antibiotic treatments favor the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, and preventive measures are insufficient to control the disease. There is increasing interest in using the potential of bacteriophages, not only for phage therapy but also for prevention and biocontrol. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a phage cocktail administered in ovo to prevent avian colibacillosis in chicks. When 4 different phages (REC, ESCO3, ESCO47, and ESCO58), stable under avian physiological conditions, were combined and inoculated at 17 embryogenic days (ED), they were transmitted to the newly hatched chicks. In a second trial, the 4-phage cocktail was inoculated into the allantoic fluid at ED16 and after hatch 1-day-old chicks were challenged with the O2 APEC strain BEN4358 inoculated subcutaneously. Two phages (REC and ESCO3) were still detected in the ceca of surviving chicks at the end of the experiment (7-days postinfection). Chicks that received the phages in ovo did not develop colibacillosis lesions and showed a significant decrease in intestinal BEN4358 load (8.00~×~107 CFU/g) compared to the challenged chicks (4.52~×~108 CFU/g). The majority of the reisolated bacteria from the ceca of surviving chicks had developed full resistance to ESCO3 phage, and only 3 were resistant to REC phage. The partially or complete resistance of REC phage induced a considerable cost to bacterial virulence. Here, we showed that phages inoculated in ovo can partially prevent colibacillosis in 1-wk-old chicks. The reduction in the APEC load in the gut and the decreased virulence of some resistant isolates could also contribute to control the disease.},

Less is known about the virome in these diseases. We show that the enteric virome is abnormal in CD and UC patients. In-depth analysis of preparations enriched for free virions in the intestine revealed that CD and UC were associated with a significant expansion of Caudovirales bacteriophages. The viromes of CD and UC patients were disease and cohort specific. Importantly, it did not appear that expansion and diversification of the enteric virome was secondary to changes in bacterial populations. These data support a model in which changes in the virome may contribute to intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. We conclude that the virome is a candidate for contributing to, or being a biomarker for, human inflammatory bowel disease and speculate that the enteric virome may play a role in other diseases.},

  abstract = {The significance of extracellular DNA (eDNA) in biofilms was overlooked until researchers added DNAse to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm and watched the biofilm disappear. Now, a decade later, the widespread importance of eDNA in biofilm formation is undisputed, but detailed knowledge about how it promotes biofilm formation and conveys antimicrobial resistance is only just starting to emerge. In this review, we discuss how eDNA is produced, how it aids bacterial adhesion, secures the structural stability of biofilms and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The appearance of eDNA in biofilms is no accident: It is produced by active secretion or controlled cell lysis – sometimes linked to competence development. eDNA adsorbs to and extends from the cell surface, promoting adhesion to abiotic surfaces through acid–base interactions. In the biofilm, is it less clear how eDNA interacts with cells and matrix components. A few eDNA-binding biomolecules have been identified, revealing new concepts in biofilm formation. Being anionic, eDNA chelates cations and restricts diffusion of cationic antimicrobials. Furthermore, chelation of Mg2+ triggers a genetic response that further increases resistance. The multifaceted role of eDNA makes it an attractive target to sensitize biofilms to conventional antimicrobial treatment or development of new strategies to combat biofilms.},

  abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen and biofilm former. Biofilms cause problems in clinics and food production and are highly recalcitrant to antibiotics and sanitizers. Bacteriophage endolysins kill bacteria by degrading their cell wall and are therefore deemed promising antimicrobials and anti-biofilm agents. Depolymerases targeting polysaccharides in the extracellular matrix have been suggested as parts of a multi-enzyme approach to eradicate biofilms. The efficacy of endolysins and depolymerases against S. aureus biofilms in static models has been demonstrated. However, there is a lack of studies evaluating their activity against biofilms grown under more realistic conditions. Here, we investigated the efficacy of the endolysin LysK and the poly-N-acetylglucosamine depolymerase DA7 against staphylococcal biofilms in static and dynamic (flow cell-based) models. LysK showed activity against multiple S. aureus strains, and both LysK and DA7 removed static and dynamic biofilms from polystyrene and glass surfaces at low micromolar and nanomolar concentrations, respectively. When combined, the enzymes acted synergistically, as demonstrated by crystal violet staining of static biofilms, significantly reducing viable cell counts compared to individual enzyme treatment in the dynamic model, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Overall, our results suggest that LysK and DA7 are potent anti-biofilm agents, alone and in combination.},

  abstract = {Phage treatment of bacterial infections has offered some hope even as the crisis of antimicrobial resistance continues to be on the rise. However, bacterial resistance to phage is another looming challenge capable of undermining the effectiveness of phage therapy. Moreover, the consideration of including phage therapy in modern medicine calls for more careful research around every aspect of phage study. In an attempt to adequately prepare for the events of phage resistance, many studies have attempted to experimentally evolve phage resistance in different bacterial strains, as well as train phages to evolve counter-infectivity of resistant bacterial mutants, in view of answering such questions as coevolutionary dynamics between phage and bacteria, mechanisms of phage resistance, fitness costs of phage resistance on bacteria, etc. In this review, we summarised many such studies and by careful examination, highlighted critical issues to the outcome of phage therapy. We also discuss the insufficiency of many of these in vitro studies to represent actual disease conditions during phage application, alongside other complications that exist in phage-bacterial evolutionary interactions. Conclusively, we present the exploitation of phage-bacterial interactions for successful infection managements, as well as some future perspectives to direct phage research.},

  abstract = {Bacterial biofilm provides bacteria with resistance and protection against conventional antimicrobial agents and the host immune system. Bacteriophages are known to move across the biofilm to make it permeable to antimicrobials. Mineral hydroxyapatite (HA) can improve the lytic activity of bacteriophages, and, together with eicosanoic acid (C20:0), can destroy the biofilm structure. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of the combined use of phage, HA and C20:0 against Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris (Xcc) biofilm. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to investigate the molecular determinants related to the lytic action, aiming at identifying the metabolic pathways dysregulated by phage treatment. Furthermore, we identified specific markers (amino acids, lactate and galactomannan) which are involved in the control of biofilm stability. Our data show that Xccϕ1, alone or in combination with HA and C20:0, interferes with the metabolic pathways involved in biofilm formation. The approach described here might be extended to other biofilm-producing bacteria.},

  abstract = {This study was carried out to assess reverse osmosis (RO) treatment efficacy of drinking water in terms of biological stability in the distribution system. Two flat-sheet RO membranes were used in this study. Experiments were designed to investigate the growth of biofilm and bulk phase bacteria for the RO-treated water flowing through a model distribution system under controlled conditions without disinfectants. RO membranes improved the water quality of drinking water in terms of inorganic, organic and bacterial contents. Organic matter including the fraction available for microbes was efficiently removed by the RO membranes tested. More than 99\% of bacterial cells in the tap water was retained by the RO membranes, leaving {$<$}50 cells/mL in the permeate water. In spite of the low nutrient contents and few cells in the RO permeates, monitoring of the model distribution systems receiving the RO permeates showed that remarkable biofilm accumulation and bulk cell growth occurred in the RO permeate water. In quasi-steady state, the total cell numbers in the biofilm and bulk water were of order 10(3) cells/cm(2) and 10(3) cells/mL, respectively, which were about 2 orders of magnitude lower than those grown in the tap water produced from conventional water treatment. The culturable heterotrophic bacteria constituted a significant part of the total cells (20.7-32.1\% in biofilms and 21.3-46.3\% in bulk waters). Biofilm maximum density and production rate were of the order 10(4) cells/cm(2) and 10(2) cells/cm(2)/day, respectively. The specific cell growth rate of bacteria in the biofilms was found to be much lower than those in the bulk waters (0.04-0.05 day(-1) versus 0.28-0.36 day(-1)). The overall specific cell growth rate which indicates the growth potential in the whole system was calculated as 0.07-0.08 day(-1), representing a doubling time of 9.1-10.1 days. These observations can be indicative of possibilities for bacterial growth in the RO permeate water with easily assimilable organic carbon concentrations below values proposed for biostability. RO permeate water does not appear to be biologically stable water. Therefore, efforts to minimize bacterial growth in the RO permeate water and in the distribution system must consider post-disinfection.},

  abstract = {Salmonella contaminated in poultry meat remains an important food safety issue as this pathogen leads to a serious foodborne illness worldwide. A number of poultry meat products have often been recalled or rejected due to Salmonella contamination leading to high economic losses each year. In poultry meat processing, various approaches with a strong bacteriostatic effect on Salmonella have been introduced including application of bacteriophages or organic acids. This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of a Salmonella phage cocktail at lower multiplicity of infection (MOI) and organic acid applied to artificially contaminated chicken meat under storage conditions. Newly isolated Salmonella phages (n~=~32) showed diverse lysis profiles exhibiting lysis ability ranging from 27.7 to 87.8\% on 29 serovars of Salmonella. Two selected phages, vB\_SenM\_P7 and vB\_SenP\_P32 presenting the highest lysis ability were used in a phage cocktail formulation. Acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid and lactic acid included in this study showed the inhibitory effect on Salmonella from 0.09 to 0.25\% for the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and more than 0.5\% for the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). A phage cocktail showed highest \% survival in propionic acid which was combined with the phage treatment. Use of this phage-acid combination not only could completely kill Salmonella in-vitro but could also lower Salmonella number on artificially contaminated chicken meat at 4~°C during a 3-day storage by 1.4 log units while a reduction of 0.4 and 1.2 log units was observed in treatment with a phage cocktail only and propionic acid only, respectively. Overall, findings suggest a combined treatment using phage and organic acid as an effective alternative for controlling Salmonella in the poultry meat industry to improve food safety.},

  abstract = {Salmonella contamination in poultry meat products can lead to serious foodborne illness and economic loss from product recalls. It is crucial to control Salmonella contamination in poultry from farm to fork. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses of bacteria that offer several advantages, especially their specificity to target bacteria. In our study, three Salmonella phages (vB\_SenS\_KP001, vB\_SenS\_KP005, and vB\_SenS\_WP110) recovered from a broiler farm and wastewater treatment stations showed high lysis ability ranging from 85.7 to 96.4\% on over 56 serovars of Salmonella derived from several sources, including livestock and a broiler farm environment. A three-phage cocktail reduced S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, in vitro by 3.9 ± 0.0 and 3.9 ± 0.2 log units at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 103 and 3.8 ± 0.4 and 4.1 ± 0.2 log units at MOI of 104 after 6 h post-phage treatment. A developed phage cocktail did not cause phage resistance in Salmonella during phage treatments for three passages. Phages could survive under simulated chicken gastrointestinal conditions in the presence of gastric acid for 2 h (100.0 ± 0.0\% survivability), bile salt for 1 h (98.1 ± 1.0\% survivability), and intestinal fluid for 4 h (100 ± 0.0\% survivability). Each phage was in the phage cocktail at a concentration of up to 9.0 log PFU/mL. These did not cause any cytotoxicity to human fibroblast cells or Caco-2 cells as indicated by the percent of cell viability, which remained nearly 100\% as compared with the control during 72 h of co-culture. The phage cocktail was given to broilers raised in commercial conditions at a 9 log PFU/dose for five doses, while naturally occurring Salmonella cells colonized in the gastrointestinal tract of broilers were significantly reduced as suggested by a considerably lower Salmonella prevalence from over 70 to 0\% prevalence after four days of phage treatment. Our findings suggest that a phage cocktail is an effective biocontrol agent to reduce Salmonella present in the guts of broilers, which can be applied to improve food safety in broiler production.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is a serious foodborne pathogen that can cause gastrointestinal disease through the consumption of contaminated foods; including poultry meat. Salmonella is commonly present in the intestinal tract of poultry and farm environments, posing a potential risk of contamination during the processing of poultry meat. This study was a continuation in evaluating the effects of our previously developed phage cocktail targeting Salmonella at large-scale trials in commercial broiler farms, in which this cocktail considerably lowered Salmonella colonization in the gut of broilers. The phage cocktail given to broilers showed resistance to temperatures of up to 65~°C ({$>$} 60\% survivability), pH ranging from 2 to 12 ({$>$} 96\% survivability), 0.5 to 15\% (w/v) NaCl ({$>$} 98\% survivability), chlorine up to 0.5\% (v/v) (53\% survivability), and chlorine neutralizer (100\% survivability). In the animal challenge study, phage treatments, designed as "prevention" and "exclusion" programs, could control Salmonella on day 20 and 32 of the experiment, respectively; as indicated by the absence of Salmonella detection in cloacal swabs from broilers (0\% prevalence). In the commercial-scale trial I, Salmonella was not detected in the phage-treated group from cloacal swabs, boot cover swabs, and bedding material samples after 16~days (0\% prevalence) of phage administration. In the commercial-scale trial II, phage treatment extended the Salmonella control period in broilers during a 40-day growout period. In summary, a phage cocktail demonstrated high efficiency in controlling various serovars of Salmonella historically linked to contamination on these broiler farms. Phage cocktail application offers an effective, alternative to enhance food safety within the poultry value chain, protecting consumers and as well as the economic sustainability of the poultry sector.},

  abstract = {Salmonella enterica (SE) is a major foodborne bacterial pathogen in the United States, commonly found as the normal flora of various animals that is attributed to causing at least 1.2 million infections annually. Poultry plays a major role in disseminating SE through direct contact with live animals and consumption of contaminated products. Vaccinating poultry against SE is a sustainable approach that can reduce SE in the host, preventing future infections in humans. An intracellular autolytic SE serovar Typhimurium vaccine (STLT2+P13+19) was developed by integrating genes 13 (holin) and 19 (lysozyme) of bacteriophage P22 into the bacterial chromosome. These were inserted downstream of sseA, an SPI-2 chaperone in SE that expresses during the intracellular phase of SE. Intracellular viability of STLT2+P13+19 reduced by 94.42\% at 24 hr compared to the wild type in chicken macrophage cells (HD-11), whereas growth rate and adhesion ability remained unchanged. Inoculating STLT2+P13+19 in HD-11 significantly enhanced the relative log fold expression of genes associated to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 p40, IL-18, and GM-CSF) and Toll-like-receptors (TRL-3 and 7). Vaccination of an in vivo chicken model demonstrated significant changes in secretion of iNOS, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-α, as well as a reduction in the intestinal colonization of SE serovar Typhimurium. Microbiome analysis of cecal fluid using 16S rRNA gene sequencing also showed modulation of intestinal microbial composition, specifically a decrease in relative abundance of Proteobacteria and increasing Firmicutes. This study provides insight into a novel vaccine design that could make food products safer without the use of synthetic compounds.},

  abstract = {This research work aimed at developing an edible biopolymeric microcapsular wrapping (EBMW) integrating lytic bacteriophage particles for Salmonella enterica, with potential application in poultry feed for biocontrol of that pathogen. This pathogen is known as one of the main microorganisms responsible for contamination in the food industry and in foodstuff. The current techniques for decontamination and pathogen control in the food industry can be very expensive, not very selective, and even outdated, such as the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that end up selecting resistant bacteria. Hence, there is a need for new technologies for pathogen biocontrol. In this context, bacteriophage-based biocontrol appears as a potential alternative. As a cocktail, both phages were able to significantly reduce the bacterial load after 12 h of treatment, at either multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 and 10, by 84.3\% and 87.6\%, respectively. Entrapment of the phage virions within the EBMW matrix did not exert any deleterious effect upon their lytic activity. The results obtained showed high promise for integration in poultry feed aiming at controlling Salmonella enterica, since the edible biopolymeric microcapsular wrapping integrating lytic bacteriophage particles developed was successful in maintaining lytic phage viability while fully stabilizing the phage particles.},

  abstract = {Microbial communities host many auxotrophs—organisms unable to synthesize one or more metabolites required for their growth. Auxotrophy is thought to confer an evolutionary advantage, yet auxotrophs must rely on other organisms that produce the metabolites they require. The mechanisms of metabolite provisioning by “producers” remain unknown. In particular, it is unclear how metabolites such as amino acids and cofactors, which are found inside the cell, are released by producers to become available to auxotrophs. Here, we explore metabolite secretion and cell lysis as two distinct possible mechanisms that result in~the release of intracellular metabolites from producer cells. We measured the extent to which secretion or lysis of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron amino acid producers can support the growth of engineered Escherichia coli amino acid auxotrophs. We found that cell-free supernatants and mechanically lysed cells provide minimal levels of amino acids to auxotrophs. In contrast, bacteriophage lysates of the same producer bacteria can support as many as 47 auxotroph cells per lysed producer cell. Each phage lysate released distinct levels of different amino acids, suggesting that in a microbial community the collective lysis of many different hosts by multiple phages could contribute to the availability of an array of intracellular metabolites for use by auxotrophs. Based on these results, we speculate that viral lysis could be a dominant mechanism of provisioning of intracellular metabolites that shapes microbial community structure.},

These substances can be found in the bacterial cell surface, such as polysaccharides, or are produced by bacteria when they are living in biofilm communities, the most common bacterial lifestyle. Consequently, phages with depolymerase activity have a facilitated access to the host receptors, by degrading the capsular polysaccharides, and are believed to have a better performance against bacterial biofilms, since the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances by depolymerases might facilitate the access of phages to the cells within different biofilm layers. Since the diversity of phage depolymerases is not yet fully explored, this is the first review gathering information about all the depolymerases encoded by fully sequenced phages. Overall, in this study, 160 putative depolymerases, including sialidases, levanases, xylosidases, dextranases, hyaluronidases, peptidases as well as pectate/pectin lyases, were found in 143 phages (43 Myoviridae, 47 Siphoviridae, 37 Podoviridae, and 16 unclassified) infecting 24 genera of bacteria. We further provide information about the main applications of phage depolymerases, which can comprise areas as diverse as medical, chemical, or food-processing industry.},

Typhimurium and 10 S. Enteritidis, to a bacteriophage cocktail was evaluated. The investigated BP cocktail had a promising lytic effect on all field isolates in this survey. The lytic activity of the BP cocktail was retained at different pH values (5.5–8) and temperatures (25°C and 37°C for 48 h; 55°C for 10 min). Physico-chemical resistance of the BP cocktail indicated that it has the potential to be used as a feed additive to control Salmonella contamination. The BP cocktail in feed contaminated with S.

  abstract = {Salmonella, a foodborne pathogen, has several serovars and subspecies that can infect and colonize variable hosts such as animals, plants, and humans. Biofilm is one of the significant attributes of the virulence of many pathogens. The Salmonella species can also form a biofilm, which facilitates their survivability and long-term persistence in harsh environmental conditions and increases the ability to transmit into new hosts. Biofilm communities are encased with a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) composed of cellulose, curli, biofilm-associated protein, and extracellular DNA. Bacterial members of the biofilm resist various antibiotics, disinfectants, detergents, UV radiation and create a significant threat to medical, food, and farming industries. Salmonella biofilm increases the mortality and morbidity rate, chronic infection, and hospitalization rate as they are resistant to various antibiotics and evade the host immune system. This chapter provides an update on the components involved in Salmonella biofilm, its complex regulatory network, and the importance of biofilm in Salmonella pathogenesis. A better understanding of the impact of biofilm in Salmonella virulence will enlighten us and help us reduce the mortality and morbidity rate that occurred by this relapsing bug.},

In sub-Saharan Africa, Salmonella Typhimurium of a novel sequence type (ST) 313 was identified and produces septicemia in the absence of gastroenteritis. No animal reservoir has been identified, and it is hypothesized that transmission occurs via human to human. In this study, we show that invasive Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 strains from Mali are poor biofilm producers compared to Salmonella Typhimurium ST19 strains, which are found worldwide and are known to be associated with gastroenteritis. We evaluated biofilms using crystal violet staining, examination of the red, dry and rough morphotype, pellicle formation and a continuous flow system. One month-old Salmonella Typhimurium ST19 colonies survived in the absence of exogenous nutrients and were highly resistant to sodium hypochlorite treatment compared to Salmonella Typhimurium ST313. This study for the first time demonstrates the comparative biofilm-forming ability and long-term survival of clinical Salmonella Typhimurium ST19 and ST313 isolates. Salmonella Typhimurium ST19 strains are strong biofilm producers and can survive desiccation compared to Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 that form weak biofilms and survive poorly following desiccation. Our data suggest that like Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 lack mechanisms that allow it to persist in the environment., Invasive Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 from Mali are poor biofilm formers and are more sensitive to desiccation compared to the classical gastroenteritis causing Salmonella Typhimurium ST19.},

In this paper, an overview of the science behind the use of feed enzymes and the current status of enzyme technology is provided. Responses to enzyme supplementation are often variable and the reasons contributing to the observed variability are discussed. Though there are opportunities to enhance nutrient utilization with enzyme supplementation, there will be physiological limits to achievable responses. These limits are imposed by the pH and digesta retention time within the digestive tract. Nutritional strategies to, at least partly, overcome these limits need to be explored; potential approaches include feeding to restore functionality of crop and gizzard as well as the use of unconventionally high doses of enzymes. Anticipated future development of better forms of feed enzymes will also lower the physiological barriers.},

Bacteriophages and their enzymes have recently become investigated as alternative treatment options. In this study, a novel Proteus bacteriophage (vB\_PmiS\_PM-CJR) was isolated from an environmental sample and fully characterized. The phage displayed depolymerase activity and the subsequent genome analysis revealed the presence of a pectate lyase domain in its tail spike protein. The protein was heterologously expressed and purified; the ability of the purified tail spike to degrade Proteus biofilms was tested. We showed that the application of the tail spike protein was able to reduce the adherence of bacterial biofilm to plastic pegs in a MBEC (minimum biofilm eradication concentration) assay and improve the survival of Galleria mellonella larvae infected with Proteus mirabilis. Our study is the first to successfully isolate and characterize a biofilm depolymerase from a Proteus phage, demonstrating the potential of this group of enzymes in treatment of Proteus infections.},

  abstract = {An E.coli-specific phage was encapsulated in three different pH responsive polymer formulations using the process of membrane emulsification. Small 100 µm capsules were fabricated and shown to afford phages suitable acid protection upon exposure to pH 1.5. Selection of polymer formulations allowed controlled release of phages at pH 5.5, pH 6 and pH 7. Other aspects of phage encapsulation including factors affecting encapsulation yield, release kinetics, acid and storage stability were evaluated. The work presented here would be useful for future evaluation of new therapeutic strategies including microbiome editing approaches allowing pH-triggered release of phages and delivery of encapsulated cargo to different intestinal compartments. The size of the capsules were selected to permit ease of delivery using small bore oral gavage tubes typically used in pre-clinical studies for evaluation of drug substances using small animal vertebrate models such as in mice and rats.},

The use of lytic bacteriophages (phages) to reduce foodborne pathogens has emerged as a promising biocontrol intervention for Salmonella spp. Here, we describe and evaluate the newly isolated Salmonella phage STGO-35-1, including: (i) genomic and phenotypic characterization, (ii) an analysis of the reduction of Salmonella in chicken meat, and (iii) genome plasticity testing. Phage STGO-35-1 represents an unclassified siphovirus, with a length of 47,483 bp, a G + C content of 46.5\%, a headful strategy of packaging, and a virulent lifestyle. Phage STGO-35-1 reduced S. Enteritidis counts in chicken meat by 2.5 orders of magnitude at 4 °C. We identified two receptor-binding proteins with affinity to LPS, and their encoding genes showed plasticity during an exposure assay. Phenotypic, proteomic, and genomic characteristics of STGO-35-1, as well as the Salmonella reduction in chicken meat, support the potential use of STGO-35-1 as a targeted biocontrol agent against S. Enteritidis in chicken meat. Additionally, computational analysis and a short exposure time assay allowed us to predict the plasticity of genes encoding putative receptor-binding proteins.},

We investigated the effects of host immunity on the efficacy of phage therapy for acute pneumonia caused by MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a mouse model. Comparing efficacies of phage-curative and prophylactic treatments in healthy immunocompetent, MyD88-deficient, lymphocyte-deficient, and neutrophil-depleted murine hosts revealed that neutrophil-phage synergy is essential for the resolution of pneumonia. Population modeling of in~vivo results further showed that~neutrophils are required to control both phage-sensitive and emergent phage-resistant variants to clear infection. This “immunophage synergy” contrasts with the paradigm that phage therapy success is largely due to bacterial permissiveness to phage killing. Lastly, therapeutic phages were not cleared by pulmonary immune effector cells and were immunologically well tolerated by lung tissues.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Chickens evolved for millions of years to be hatched in a nest in contact with an adult hen. However, current commercial production of chickens is based on hatching chicks in a clean hatchery environment in the absence of adult hens. The ancestors of domestic chickens inhabited a living environment different from that used for current commercial production. Currently, the lifespan of broilers is around 5 weeks, the lifespan of egg layers is around one year while chickens can live for 15–20 years. This means that studies on chicken–microbiota interactions are of specific importance. The intestinal tract of commercially hatched chicks is gradually colonised from environmental sources only, however, if the chicks are provided experimentally with microbiota from a hen they can be colonised by adult-type microbiota from the very first days of life and become resistant to infections with pathogenic Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, or Salmonella. Because of such specificities in the interactions of chickens with their gut microbiota, current knowledge in this area is critically presented in this review. Abstract Studies analyzing the composition of gut microbiota are quite common at present, mainly due to the rapid development of DNA sequencing technologies within the last decade. This is valid also for chickens and their gut microbiota. However, chickens represent a specific model for host–microbiota interactions since contact between parents and offspring has been completely interrupted in domesticated chickens. Nearly all studies describe microbiota of chicks from hatcheries and these chickens are considered as references and controls. In reality, such chickens represent an extreme experimental group since control chicks should be, by nature, hatched in nests in contact with the parent hen. Not properly realising this fact and utilising only 16S rRNA sequencing results means that many conclusions are of questionable biological relevance. The specifics of chicken-related gut microbiota are therefore stressed in this review together with current knowledge of the biological role of selected microbiota members. These microbiota members are then evaluated for their intended use as a form of next-generation probiotics.},

The proteome is the entire set of proteins that is expressed by a genome and the core proteome are all orthologous proteins detected in a given sample set. In this study we have investigated differential expression of the core proteomes of the Salmonella serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Typhimurium and Enteritidis, as well as the regulating molecules. Our comparative proteome analysis indicated differences in the expression of surface proteins between the serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, and in pathogenesis-related proteins between Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Our findings in proteome-wide expression may guide the development of novel diagnostics and vaccines for Salmonella, as well as understanding of disease.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages are generally specific, and a cocktail of phages is needed to combat different bacterial targets. Their production usually requires pathogenic isolation hosts. We identified a novel strain, Escherichia coli ST155, that could serve as a production host for three different polyvalent phages (ϕPh\_SE03, ϕPh\_SD01, and ϕPh\_EC01), thus superseding the use of individual isolation hosts. Upon propagation in E. coli ST155, the phages demonstrated differential intergeneric infectivity against Salmonella enterica, E. coli OP50, Shigella dysenteriae, E. coli MDR, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Phages were characterised based on morphology, latent period, burst size, the efficiency of plating, and restriction enzyme profile. Survival assay on Caenorhabditis elegans, the absence of Shiga toxin, and enterotoxigenic E. coli virulence genes indicated that E. coli ST155 could be non-pathogenic. Lack of antibiotic resistance and absence of functional prophages rendered the host suitable for environmental applications. As a proof-of-concept, phage ϕPh\_SE03 was produced in ST155 by employing a unique Bacteriophage Amplification Reactor-Lytics Broadcasting System and was simultaneously disseminated into S. enterica augmented wastewater, which resulted in a 3-log reduction in 24~h. The study establishes the potential of E. coli ST155 as a phage production host thereby minimising the possibility of accidental release of pathogenic hosts into wastewater.},

To achieve this knowledge it is essential to develop mathematical models able to explain and simulate the population dynamics of phage and bacteria. We have developed an unstructured mathematical model using delay-differential equations to predict the interactions between a broad-host-range Salmonella phage and its pathogenic host. The model takes into consideration the main biological parameters that rule phage-bacteria interactions likewise the adsorption rate, latent period, burst size, bacterial growth rate, and substrate uptake rate, among others. The experimental validation of the model was performed with data from phage-interaction studies in a 5 L bioreactor. The key and innovative aspect of the model was the introduction of variations in the latent period and adsorption rate values that are considered as constants in previous developed models. By modelling the latent period as a normal distribution of values and the adsorption rate as a function of the bacterial growth rate it was possible to accurately predict the behaviour of the phage-bacteria population. The model was shown to predict simulated data with a good agreement with the experimental observations and explains how a lytic phage and its host bacteria are able to coexist.},

On day 13, 15 chickens from each treatment were challenged by Salmonella Enteritidis (SE), while fifteen from each treatment were not; instead, they were kept in the same cage with the challenged chickens (exposed chickens). At 7 and 14~days post-challenge, the number of SE and coliform bacteria in the cecum and liver of colistin and BP-fed birds was lower than the control treatment. In exposed and challenged chickens, the height and surface area of villus were greater in the BP and colistin-supplemented groups. Serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase were greater, while serum albumin and triglycerides concentrations were lower in the control treatment. The liver of the challenged chickens had more pathological lesions than exposed birds. BP significantly decreased PPARγ gene expression in exposed chickens. In the challenged and exposed chickens, TLR4 gene expression was lower in BP and colistin-treated birds as compared to the control. In conclusion, adding BP to the diet from the day of age prevents the spread of Salmonella.},

Aquaculture is currently undergoing a dynamic development, but the intensification of production increases the risk of bacterial diseases. In recent years, there has been a drastic development in the resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents approved for use, which has also taken place in aquaculture. Consequently, animal mortality and economic losses in livestock have increased. The use of drugs in closed systems is an additional challenge as it can damage biological filters. For this reason, there has been a growing interest in natural methods of combating pathogens. One of the methods is the use of bacteriophages both for prophylactic purposes and therapy. This work summarizes the diverse results of the in vivo application of bacteriophages for the prevention and control of bacterial pathogens in aquatic animals to provide a reference for further research on bacteriophages in aquaculture and to compare major achievements in the field.},

Here we report the genome organization of phi92, the cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction of its virion, and the reinvestigation of its host specificity. The genome consists of a linear, double-stranded 148,612-bp DNA sequence containing 248 potential open reading frames and 11 putative tRNA genes. Orthologs were found for 130 of the predicted proteins. Most of the virion proteins showed significant sequence similarities to proteins of myoviruses rv5 and PVP-SE1, indicating that phi92 is a new member of the novel genus of rv5-like phages. Reinvestigation of phi92 host specificity showed that the host range is not limited to polysialic acid-encapsulated               Escherichia coli               but includes most laboratory strains of               Escherichia coli               and many               Salmonella               strains. Structure analysis of the phi92 virion demonstrated the presence of four different types of tail fibers and/or tailspikes, which enable the phage to use attachment sites on encapsulated and nonencapsulated bacteria. With this report, we provide the first detailed description of a multivalent, multispecies phage armed with a host cell adsorption apparatus resembling a nanosized Swiss army knife. The genome, structure, and, in particular, the organization of the baseplate of phi92 demonstrate how a bacteriophage can evolve into a multi-pathogen-killing agent.},

How bacteria assemble polymers into biofilms is largely unknown. We find that the extracellular matrix produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa self-assembles into a liquid crystal through entropic interactions between polymers and filamentous Pf bacteriophages, which are long, negatively charged filaments. This liquid crystalline structure enhances biofilm function by increasing adhesion and tolerance to desiccation and antibiotics. Pf bacteriophages are prevalent among P.~aeruginosa clinical isolates and were detected in CF sputum. The addition of Pf bacteriophage to sputum polymers or serum was sufficient to drive their rapid assembly into viscous liquid crystals. Fd,~a related bacteriophage of Escherichia coli, has~similar biofilm-building capabilities. Targeting filamentous bacteriophage or the liquid crystalline organization of the biofilm matrix may represent antibacterial strategies.},

  abstract = {The exploration of novel nonantibiotic interventions in the field, such as the use of bacteriophages, is necessary to avoid the presence of Salmonella. Bacteriophages are a group of viruses widely distributed in nature, strictly associated with the prokaryotic cell. Researchers have demonstrated the success of phage therapy in reducing Salmonella counts in poultry products. However, the impact that phage concentration in the environment may have against certain Salmonella serovars is not well understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess Salmonella phage prevalence in commercial poultry farms in terms of the production type: layers or broilers. The most prevalent Salmonella serovars isolated in poultry production were used for phage isolation. Salmonella specific phages were isolated from 141 layer and broiler farms located in the Valencia region during 2019. Analysis of the samples revealed that 100\% presented Salmonella phages, the most prevalent being against serovar S. Enteritidis (93\%), followed by S. Virchow (59\%), S. Typhimurium (55\%), S. Infantis (52\%) and S. Ohio (51\%). These results indicate that poultry farms could represent an important source of Salmonella phages. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to assess the epidemiology of phages against other serovars present in other countries and their diversity from the point of view of molecular studies.},

For this reason, innovative techniques, as bacteriophages, could be implemented to control the bacteria. The main objectives of this study were to assess the effect of bacteriophages against Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella Enteritidis on farm surfaces, and to evaluate bacteriophage procedure application as sanitiser against Salmonella in field conditions. Thus, most prevalent serovars in poultry production were selected (Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella Enteritidis) to contaminate farm facilities. Then, two specific bacteriophages isolated from poultry faeces were applied against them. Results showed Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella Enteritidis decreased of 4.55 log10CFU/mL and 3.85 log10CFU/mL, respectively; the maximum reduction in Salmonella was the 5th day, after 108 PFU/mL and 103 PFU/mL bacteriophage application. These results highlight bacteriophages as a promising tool together with cleaning and disinfection.},

Contaminated poultry eggs and meat products are the major sources of human Salmonella infection. Horizontal and vertical transmission are the primary routes of infection in chickens. The principal virulence genes linked to Salmonella pathogenesis in poultry are located in Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2). Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are involved in the defense against Salmonella invasion in poultry. Vaccination of chickens and supplementation of feed additives like prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, synbiotics, and bacteriophages are currently being used to mitigate the Salmonella load in poultry. Despite the existence of various control measures, there is still a need for a broad, safe, and well-defined strategy that can confer long-term protection from Salmonella in poultry flocks. This review examines the current knowledge on the etiology, transmission, cell wall structure, nomenclature, pathogenesis, immune response, and efficacy of preventative approaches to Salmonella.},

Such information can inform animal and human trials, and much can be ascertained from human cell-line work. We have developed a human cell-based system using Clostridium difficile, a pernicious hospital pathogen with limited treatment options, and the phage phiCDHS1 that effectively kills this bacterium in liquid culture. The human colon tumorigenic cell line HT-29 was used because it simulates the colon environment where C. difficile infection occurs. Studies on the dynamics of phage-bacteria interactions revealed novel facets of phage biology, showing that phage can reduce C. difficile numbers more effectively in the presence of HT-29 cells than in vitro. Both planktonic and adhered Clostridial cell numbers were successfully reduced. We hypothesise and demonstrate that this observation is due to strong phage adsorption to the HT-29 cells, which likely promotes phage-bacteria interactions. The data also showed that the phage phiCDHS1 was not toxic to HT-29 cells, and phage-mediated bacterial lysis did not cause toxin release and cytotoxic effects. The use of human cell lines to understand phage-bacterial dynamics offers valuable insights into phage biology in vivo, and can provide informative data for human trials.},

  abstract = {The first step of bacteriophage (phage) infection is the attachment of the phage virion onto a susceptible host cell. This adsorption process is usually described by mass-action kinetics, which implicitly assume an equal influence of host density and adsorption rate on the adsorption process. Therefore, an environment with high host density can be considered as equivalent to a phage endowed with a high adsorption rate, and vice versa. On the basis of this assumption, the effect of adsorption rate on the evolution of phage optimal lysis time can be reinterpreted from previous optimality models on the evolution of optimal lysis time. That is, phage strains with a higher adsorption rate would have a shorter optimal lysis time and vice versa. Isogenic phage λ-strains with different combinations of six different lysis times (ranging from 29.3 to 68 min), two adsorption rates (9.9 × 10−9 and 1.3 × 10−9 phage−1 cell−1 ml−1 min−1), and two markers (resulting in “blue” or “white” plaques) were constructed. Various pairwise competitions among these strains were conducted to test the model prediction. As predicted by the reinterpreted model, the results showed that the optimal lysis time is shorter for phage strains with a high adsorption rate and vice versa. Competition between high- and low-adsorption strains also showed that, under current conditions and phenotype configurations, the adsorption rate has a much larger impact on phage relative fitness than the lysis time.},

  abstract = {Phages, which are often used therapeutically, have begun to receive interest as alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) for enhancing chicken growth. Another option that has been extensively studied as a growth promoter in chickens is probiotics. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study available on the use of phages and probiotics in combination as potential feed additives for broiler chickens. Therefore, this study demonstrated the effects of a phage cocktail, probiotics, and their combination on the growth performance and gut microbiota of broiler chickens. A total of 288 one-day-old male Cobb 500 broilers were randomly allotted to one of six treatments in a completely randomised design. The treatments were (i) C (basal diet (BD) only), (ii) 1φ (BD + 0.1\% phage cocktail), (iii) 2φ (BD + 0.2\% phage cocktail), (iv) P (BD + 0.1\% probiotic), (v) 1φP (BD + 0.1\% phage cocktail + 0.1\% probiotic), and (vi) 2φP (BD + 0.2\% phage cocktail + 0.1\% probiotic). The 1φP treatment had significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) better BW (35 days), BWG (22–35 days, 1–35 days), and FCR (1–21 days, 22–35 days, 1–35 days) compared to C. Unique gut microbiota diversity was also found between the φP (1φP and 2φP) and non-φP groups (C, 1φ, 2φ, and P) in ilea, particularly in the 35-day-old chickens. Microorganisms associated with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers were significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) more present in the φP group than in the non-φP group. The predicted genes related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were significantly upregulated in φP groups compared to non-φP groups. These genes were involved in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, as well as the production of energy. Our findings showed that the 1φP treatment could be a potential alternative to AGPs for poultry, as growth performance was enhanced, and gut microbiota was positively modulated.},

  abstract = {Background Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium is a Gram-negative pathogen causing salmonellosis. Salmonella Typhimurium-targeting bacteriophages have been proposed as an alternative biocontrol agent to antibiotics. To further understand infection and interaction mechanisms between the host strains and the bacteriophages, the receptor diversity of these phages needs to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-five Salmonella phages were isolated and their receptors were identified by screening a Tn5 random mutant library of S. Typhimurium SL1344. Among them, three types of receptors were identified flagella (11 phages), vitamin B12 uptake outer membrane protein, BtuB (7 phages) and lipopolysaccharide-related O-antigen (7 phages). TEM observation revealed that the phages using flagella (group F) or BtuB (group B) as a receptor belong to Siphoviridae family, and the phages using O-antigen of LPS as a receptor (group L) belong to Podoviridae family. Interestingly, while some of group F phages (F-I) target FliC host receptor, others (F-II) target both FliC and FljB receptors, suggesting that two subgroups are present in group F phages. Cross-resistance assay of group B and L revealed that group L phages could not infect group B phage-resistant strains and reversely group B phages could not infect group L SPN9TCW-resistant strain. Conclusions/Significance In this report, three receptor groups of 25 newly isolated S. Typhimurium-targeting phages were determined. Among them, two subgroups of group F phages interact with their host receptors in different manner. In addition, the host receptors of group B or group L SPN9TCW phages hinder other group phage infection, probably due to interaction between receptors of their groups. This study provides novel insights into phage-host receptor interaction for Salmonella phages and will inform development of optimal phage therapy for protection against Salmonella.},

Every 48\,h half of all bacteria on Earth are killed by phages. Efficient killing also forms the basis of phage therapy in humans and animals and the use of phages as food pre­ servatives. In turn, bacteria have a plethora of resistance systems against phage attack, but very few bacterial species, if any, have entirely escaped phage predation. However, in complex com­ munities and environments such as the human gut, this antagonistic model of attack and counterdefence does not fully describe the scope of phage–bacterium interactions. In this Review, we explore some of the more mutualistic aspects of phage–bacterium interactions in the human gut, and we suggest that the relationship between phages and their bacterial hosts in the gut is best characterized not as a fight to the death between enemies but rather as a mutualistic relationship between partners.},

Therefore, there is a need to unify the method to effectively detect the PAS effect, at its most basic in vitro test. In this study, bacteriophage T45 and 43 antibiotics belonging to different antibiotic classes were used. Seven different DLA method modifications were tested, in terms of antibiotic addition placement and presence or absence of the base agar. The overall number of phage plaques per plate mainly depended on the antibiotic used. Differences in plaque quantity depended on the type of the DLA method modification. The largest total number of plaques was obtained by the addition of an antibiotic to a bottom agar with the presence of a top agar. This indicates that even though an antibiotic could manifest the PAS effect by a standard disk method, it would be worth examining if the effect is equally satisfactory when applying antibiotics directly into the agar, with regards to using the same bacteriophage and bacterial host.},

We performed three controlled chicken trials (n = 96) to investigate caecal microbiota differences between the best and poorest performing birds using four performance measures; feed conversion ratio (FCR), utilization of energy from the feed measured as apparent metabolisable energy, gain rate (GR), and amount of feed eaten (FE). The shifts in microbiota composition associated with the performance measures were very different between the three trials. Analysis of the caecal microbiota revealed that the high and low FCR birds had significant differences in the abundance of some bacteria as demonstrated by shifts in microbiota alpha and beta diversity. Trials 1 and 2 showed significant overall community shifts, however, the microbial changes driving the difference between good and poor performers were very different. Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae families and genera Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium and multiple lineages of genus Clostridium (from families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae) were highly abundant in good FCR birds in Trial 1. Different microbiota was associated with FCR in Trial 2; Catabacteriaceae and unknown Clostridiales family members were increased in good FCR and genera Clostridium (from family Clostridiaceae) and Lactobacillus were associated with poor FCR. Trial 3 had only mild microbiota differences associated with all four performance measures. Overall, the genus Lactobacillus was correlated with feed intake which resulted in poor FCR performance. The genus Faecalibacterium correlated with improved FCR, increased GR and reduced FE. There was overlap in phylotypes correlated with improved FCR and GR, while different microbial cohorts appeared to be correlated with FE. Even under controlled conditions different cohorts of birds developed distinctly different microbiotas. Within the different trial groups the abundance of certain bacterial groups correlated with productivity outcomes.

  abstract = {The ability of Salmonella to form complex surface-associated communities, called biofilms, contributes to its resistance and persistence in both host and non-host environments and is especially important in food processing environments. In this review, the different types of abiotic (plastic, glass, cement, rubber, and stainless steel) and biotic surfaces (plant surfaces, epithelial cells, and gallstones) on which Salmonella biofilms have been described are discussed, as well as a number of commonly used laboratory setups to study Salmonella biofilm formation (rdar morphotype, pellicle formation, and biofilms on polystyrene pegs). Furthermore, the structural components important during Salmonella biofilm formation are described (curli and other fimbriae, BapA, flagella, cellulose, colanic acid, anionic O-antigen capsule and fatty acids), with special attention to the structural variations of biofilms grown on different surfaces and under different conditions. Indeed, biofilm formation is strongly influenced by different environmental signals, via a complex regulatory network. An extensive overview is given on the current understanding of this genetic network and the interactions between its different components (CsgD, RpoS, Crl, OmpR, IHF, H-NS, CpxR, MlrA, c-di-GMP, BarA/SirA, Csr, PhoPQ, RstA, Rcs, metabolic processes and quorum sensing). To further illustrate that biofilm formation is a mechanism of Salmonella to adapt to different environments, the resistance of Salmonella biofilms against different stress factors including desiccation stress, disinfectants (e.g. hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, cationic tensides and triclosan) and antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) is described. Finally, a number of Salmonella biofilm inhibitors, identified through bottom-up- and top-down-approaches, are discussed, such as surfactin, glucose, halogenated furanones, 4(5)-aryl 2-aminoimidazoles, furocoumarins and salicylates. Also the potential of combination therapy (e.g. combinations of triclosan and quaternary ammonium salts or halogenated furanones and antibiotics/disinfectants) and nano- and micro-emulsions to inhibit Salmonella biofilm formation is discussed. Insight into the pathogen's complex biofilm process will eventually lead to further unraveling of its intricacies and more efficient strategies to combat Salmonella biofilms.},

Methods: Quantification of biofilm formation was performed in brain heart infusion (BHI), trypcase soya broth (TSB), meat broth (MB) and 1/20 diluted trypcase soya broth (1/20-TSB) in plastic microtitre plates. Results: All tested Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes strains produced biofilm in a suitable medium. However, the quantities of biofilm produced by Salmonella spp. were greater than those produced by tested L. monocytogenes strains. The nutrient content of the medium significantly influenced the quantity of produced biofilm. Diluted TSB was the most effective in promoting biofilm production by Salmonella spp., followed by TSB, while the least quantity of biofilm was formed in BHI and MB. L. monocytogenes produced the highest quantities of biofilm in BHI, followed by TSA, then MB, and the least quantities of biofilm were produced in 1/20-TSB. Conclusions: Salmonella spp. produces more biofilm in nutrient-poor medium, while L. monocytogenes produce more biofilm in nutrient-rich medium.},

This review aims to give an overview of retention time of material through the digestive tract in an attempt to reveal mechanisms relating flow and retention of material to the digestive process. The mean retention time based on marker content in the different segments of the digestive tract or measured as time of 50\% marker excreted is remarkably short at between 5 and 6 h, but varies considerably due to method used, diet composition, and feeding pattern. Mean retention time in the small intestine is commonly reported to be around 3 h, with 1 h retention time in the tract proximal to Meckel’s diverticulum, and is less affected by diet or feeding pattern. The mechanism explaining a high nutrient digestion and absorption despite this astonishingly short time is still a puzzle. A selective flow and reflux of material throughout the small intestine seems to be a potential mechanism, but more research is needed in this important and fascinating area of poultry research.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is one of the most common zoonotic foodborne pathogens and a worldwide public health threat. Salmonella enterica is the most pathogenic among Salmonella species, comprising over 2500 serovars. It causes typhoid fever and gastroenteritis, and the serovars responsible for the later disease are known as non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). Salmonella transmission to humans happens along the farm-to-fork continuum via contaminated animal- and plant-derived foods, including poultry, eggs, fish, pork, beef, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and flour. Several virulence factors have been recognized to play a vital role in attaching, invading, and evading the host defense system. These factors include capsule, adhesion proteins, flagella, plasmids, and type III secretion systems that are encoded on the Salmonella pathogenicity islands. The increased global prevalence of NTS serovars in recent years indicates that the control approaches centered on alleviating the food animals’ contamination along the food chain have been unsuccessful. Moreover, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella variants suggests a potential food safety crisis. This review summarizes the current state of the knowledge on the nomenclature, microbiological features, virulence factors, and the mechanism of antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella. Furthermore, it provides insights into the pathogenesis and epidemiology of Salmonella infections. The recent outbreaks of salmonellosis reported in different clinical settings and geographical regions, including Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America, Europe, and the USA in the farm-to-fork continuum, are also highlighted.},

Previous studies have established a primary role of the microbiota composition and intestinal permeability in such pathologies. Using a rat model, we examined the effects of exposure to a bacteriophage cocktail on intestinal permeability and relative abundance of taxonomic units in the gut bacterial community. There was an increase in markers of impaired gut permeability, such as the lactulose/mannitol ratio, plasma endotoxin concentrations, and serum levels of inflammation-related cytokines, following the bacteriophage challenge. We observed significant differences in the alpha diversity of faecal bacterial species and found that richness and diversity index values increased following the bacteriophage challenge. There was a reduction in the abundance of               Blautia, Catenibacterium, Lactobacillus               , and               Faecalibacterium               species and an increase in               Butyrivibrio, Oscillospira               and               Ruminococcus               after bacteriophage administration.

  abstract = {Salmonella-specific bacteriophages (BP) and competitive exclusion (CE) were used to reduce Salmonella colonization in experimentally infected chickens. A ‘‘cocktail’’ of distinct phage (i.e., phage showing different host ranges and inducing different types of plaques on Salmonella Typhimurium [ST] cultures) was developed. The killing activity of the selected BPs on ST cultures differed significantly, as determined in in vitro killing assays. BPs were administered orally to the chickens several days prior and after ST challenge but not simultaneously. BPs were readily isolated from the feces of the BP-treated chickens approximately 48 hr after administration. A CE product consisting of a defined culture of seven different microbial species was used either alone or in combination with BP treatment. CE was administered orally at hatch. Salmonella counts in intestine, ceca, and a pool of liver/spleen were evaluated in Salmonella-challenged chickens treated with BP or with BP and CE. In both trials 1 and 2, a beneficial effect of the phage treatment on weight gain performance was evident. A reduction in Salmonella counts was detected in cecum and ileum of BP-, CE-, and BPþCE-treated chickens as compared with nontreated birds. In trial 1, BP treatment reduced ST counts to marginal levels in the ileum and reduced counts sixfold in the ceca. A reduction of Salmonella counts with BP, CE, and BPþCE treatments was evident in chickens from trial 2. Both CE and BP treatments showed differences in the reduction of Salmonella counts after challenge between specimens obtained at days 4 and 14 postchallenge in ceca, liver/spleen, and ileum. The preliminary data presented in this report show that isolation and characterization of Salmonella-specific BP is uncomplicated and feasible on a larger scale. Results indicate a protective effect of both Salmonella-specific BPs and a defined competitive exclusion product against Salmonella colonization of experimentally infected chickens. These results are encouraging for further work on the use of BP as an effective alternative to antibiotics to reduce Salmonella infections in poultry.},

  abstract = {Poultry products are one of the major transmission media of Salmonella enteritidis to humans. A promising alternative to reduce the load of Salmonella in poultry are bacteriophages. Elsewhere, a mixture of six bacteriophages has been used successfully, but large-scale production would be necessary to supply potential poultry market and costs analyses have not been calculated yet. For this, a powerful tool to predict production costs is bioprocess modeling coupled with economic analyses. This work aims to model the scaled-up production of a six bacteriophages mixture based on a laboratory/pilot-scale production using Biosolve Process. For the model construction, a combination of experimental and reported data was applied, in which different production alternatives and the range of 1-100\% of the Colombian poultry market (at broiler's farm and slaughterhouse) were analyzed. Results indicate that the best cost-effective process configuration/scale is to use one bioreactor (156\,L) for the six bacteriophages, then a 0.45\,μm filtration for removal of biomass, and a 0.22\,μm filtration for sterility; this to supply the 35\% of the market size for broiler farms (equivalent to 210 million chickens). This configuration gives a production cost per chicken of US\$ 0.02. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis and a theoretical contrast for understanding the impact that titer and recovery have on production scale determined that titer affects the most the cost and requires optimization. The present works serves as a first, and required, approach for the development of phage therapy products that are alternatives to present-day pathogens control strategies.},

The SP6 tailspikes are recognized as important in host range determination but the mechanisms underlying dual host specificity are unknown. Cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram classification were used to analyze the SP6 virion with a particular focus on the interaction of tailspikes with host membranes. The SP6 tail is surrounded by six V-shaped structures that interconnect in forming a hand-over-hand hexameric garland. Each V-shaped structure consists of two trimeric tailspike proteins: gp46 and gp47, connected through the adaptor protein gp37. SP6 infection of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Newport results in distinguishable changes in tailspike orientation, providing the first direct demonstration how tailspikes can confer dual host adsorption specificity. SP6 also infects S. Typhimurium strains lacking O antigen; in these infections tailspikes have no apparent specific role and the phage tail must therefore interact with a distinct host receptor to allow infection.},

  abstract = {Background: Effective antibiotic alternatives are urgently needed in the poultry industry to control disease outbreaks. Phage therapy mainly utilizes lytic phages to kill their respective bacterial hosts and can be an attractive solution to combating the emergence of antibiotic resistance in livestock. Methods: Five hundred and four, one-day-old broilers (Ross 308) were allotted to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a completely randomized design. Treatments consisted of CON (basal diet), PC (CON + 0.025\% Avilamax®), BP 0.05 (CON + 0.05\% bacteriophage), and BP 0.10 (CON + 0.10\% bacteriophage). Results: A significant linear effect on body weight gain (BWG) was observed during days 1–7, days 22–35, and cumulatively in bacteriophage (BP) supplemented groups. The BWG tended to be higher (P = 0.08) and the feed intake (FI) was increased (P = 0.017) in the PC group over CON group. A greater (P = 0.016) BWG and trends in increased FI (P = 0.06) were observed in the experiment in birds fed PC than CON diet. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was decreased in PC (65.28\%), while it was similar in BP 0.05 and BP 0.10 (90.65\%, 86.72\%) compared to CON (90.19\%). At the species level, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus salivarus was higher in BP 0.05 (40.15\%) and BP 0.10 (38.58\%) compared to the CON (20.04\%) and PC (18.05\%). A linear reduction in the weight of bursa of Fabricius (P = 0.022) and spleen (P = 0.052) was observed in birds fed graded level of BP and an increase (P = 0.059) in the weight of gizzard was observed in birds fed PC over BP diets. Linear and quadratic responses were observed in redness of breast muscle color in birds fed graded level of BP. Conclusions: The inclusion of the 0.05\% and 0.1\% BP cocktail linearly improved broiler weight during the first 7 days, 22–35 days and cumulatively, whereas 0.05\% BP addition was sufficient for supporting immune organs, bursa and spleen as well as enhancing gut microbiome, indicating the efficacy of 0.05\% BP as a substitute antibiotic growth promoter in broiler diets.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, as ubiquitous bacterial viruses in various natural ecosystems, play an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of the natural microbiota. For many years, bacteriophages were not believed to act on eukaryotic cells; however, recent studies have confirmed their ability to affect eukaryotic cells and interact with the host immune system. Due to their complex protein structure, phages can also directly or indirectly modulate immune processes, including innate immunity, by modulating phagocytosis and cytokine reactions, as well as acquired immunity, by producing antibodies and activating effector cells. They can therefore have a profound impact on the course of bacterial infections by stimulating and at the same time inhibiting the systemic pro-inflammatory response. This review article presents a characterization of the processes by which bacteriophages affect selected immune mechanisms in selected animal species. The results of our own experiments using calves are also presented as examples. The paper contains many new examples of potential uses of bacteriophages and their effects on eukaryotic cells, especially in the course of bacterial infections, which are extremely important in experimental treatments exploiting phages as alternatives to antibiotics. The positive results of the effects of bacteriophages on eukaryotic cells during infections open up promising new prospects for their use as natural tools in the treatment of bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases in animals and humans.},

The observed immune response was shown to be endotoxin-independent and predominantly anti-inflammatory. Addition of endotoxins to the highly purified phages did not cause an immune response comparable to the one induced by the (endotoxin containing) phage lysate. In addition, the use of an intermediate level of endotoxins tipped the immune response to a more anti-inflammatory response, i.e. up-regulation of IL1RN and a strongly reduced expression of CXCL1 and CXCL5.},

  abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in bacteriophage genomes are widespread across bacterial host genera, but their exact function has remained unclear for more than 50 years. Several hypotheses have been proposed, and the most widely accepted one is codon compensation, which suggests that phages encode tRNAs that supplement codons that are less frequently used by the host. Here, we combine several observations and propose a new hypothesis that phage-­encoded tRNAs counteract the tRNA-d­ epleting strategies of the host using enzymes such as VapC, PrrC, Colicin D, and Colicin E5 to defend from viral infection. Based on mutational patterns of anticodon loops of tRNAs encoded by phages, we predict that these tRNAs are insensitive to host tRNAses. For phage-­ encoded tRNAs targeted in the anticodon itself, we observe that phages typically avoid encoding these tRNAs, further supporting the hypothesis that phage tRNAs are selected to be insensitive to host anticodon nucleases. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that phage-­encoded tRNAs have evolved to be insensitive to host anticodon nucleases.},

Unfortunately host responses to Salmonella are complex with many factors involved. To learn more about responses to Salmonella in young chickens, a cDNA microarray analysis was performed to compare gene expression profiles between two chicken lines under control and Salmonella infected conditions. Newly hatched chickens were orally infected with S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. Since the intestine is the first barrier the bacteria encounter after oral inoculation, intestinal gene expression was investigated at different timepoints. Differences in gene expression between the two chicken lines were found in control as well as Salmonella infected conditions. In response to the Salmonella infection a fast growing chicken broiler line induced genes that affect T-cell activation, whereas in a slow growing broiler line genes involved in macrophage activation seemed to be more affected at day 1 post-infection. At days 7 and 9 most gene expression differences between the two chicken lines were identified under control conditions, indicating a difference in the intestinal development between the two chicken lines which might be linked to the difference in Salmonella susceptibility. The findings in this study have lead to the identification of novel genes and possible cellular pathways, which are host dependent.},

A sequential method to devise a suitable phage cocktail with a broad host range and high lytic efficiency against a biofilm forming XDR P. aeruginosa strain is presented here. Out of a total thirteen phages isolated against P. aeruginosa, five were selected on the basis of their high lytic spectra assessed using spot assay and productivity by efficiency of plating assay. Phages, after selection, were tested individually and in combinations of two-, three-, four-, and five-phage cocktails using liquid infection model. Out of total 22 combinations tested, the cocktail comprising four phages viz. φPA170, φPA172, φPA177, and φPA180 significantly inhibited the bacterial growth in liquid infection model (p {$<$} 0.0001). The minimal inhibitory dose of each phage in a cocktail was effectively reduced to {$>$}10 times than the individual dose in the inhibition of XDR P. aeruginosa host. Field emission-scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize phage cocktail mediated eradication of 4-day-old multi-layers of XDR P. aeruginosa biofilms from urinary catheters and glass cover slips, and was confirmed by absence of any viable cells. Differential bacterial inhibition was observed with different phage combinations where multiple phages were found to enhance the cocktail’s lytic range, but the addition of too many phages reduced the overall inhibition. This study elaborates an effective and sequential method for the preparation of a phage cocktail and evaluates its antimicrobial potential against biofilm forming XDR strains of P. aeruginosa.},

Due to its polyvalent nature, the bacteriophage fp01 has potential applications in the biomedical, food and agricultural industries. Also, fundamental aspects of polyvalent bacteriophage biology are unknown. In this study, we sequenced and described the complete genome of the polyvalent phage fp01 (MH745368.2) using long- (MinION, Nanopore) and short-reads (MiSeq, Illumina) sequencing. The bacteriophage fp01 genome has 109,515 bp, double-stranded DNA with an average G+C content of 39\%, and 158 coding sequences (CDSs). Phage fp01 has genes with high similarity to Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella sp. phages. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the phage fp01 is a new Tequintavirus fp01 specie. Receptor binding protein gp108 was identified as potentially responsible for fp01 polyvalent characteristics, which binds to conserved amino acid regions of the FhuA receptor of Enterobacteriaceae.},

  abstract = {Salmonella Enteritidis remains a leading cause of human foodborne disease, mostly associated with the consumption of contaminated poultry products. To more strategically implement a phage therapy scheme for S. Enteritidis control in broilers, a cocktail containing three wild-type lytic bacteriophages (LBs) previously isolated from chickens was evaluated shortly and later after a challenge. Genomic characterization, lytic spectrum and in vitro efficacy were determined for each studied LB. In independent trials, broilers challenged with S. Enteritidis on day of hatch received phage therapy from 6 to 10 days of age (early treatment), and from 31 to 35 days of age (later treatment). S. Enteritidis analyses were performed before treatment and at 1, 4, 7 and 10 days posttreatment (dpt) in both trials. Partial DNA sequence analysis of each LB revealed close similarity to the Ackermannviridae family. LBs lysed different Salmonella enterica serovars, while other tested bacteria were refractory. An in-vitro reduction of 1.49, 0.65 and 0.58 log10 CFU/mL in S. Enteritidis number was obtained after co-incubation for 3 h with each LB. Both in vivo trials showed a significant reduction in the average number of intestinal S. Enteritidis calculated after phage therapy compared with controls. However, the highest efficiency was found in the later therapy, which resulted in a reduction of 1.08 log10 CFU/g in the average from 4 to 10 dpt, showing potential for future use as a pre-harvest strategy to reduce the S. Enteritidis intestinal colonization in broilers on farms.},

Phages were enriched from faecal slurries by culture in 10× trypticase soy broth at 37°C overnight. Phage plaques were obtained by mixing the filtered culture supernatant with molten tryptone agar containing the phage E. coli host strain, pouring the inoculated agar on top of cooled TS agar and incubating the culture overnight. Phages were purified from plaques and screened against additional E. coli and EHEC strains by the efficiency of plating method (EOP). Phage CEV2, and five other phages previously isolated, were able to lyse all of the 15 O157 strains tested with EOP values consistently above 0·001. Two phages were found to be highly effective against strains of E. coli O157 through EOP tests and against O26 strains through spot tests, but not against the O serogroup 111 strains. A cocktail of eight phage that lyse E. coli O157 strains resulted in \&gt;5 log CFU ml−1 reductions at 37°C. Multiplex‐PCR revealed that none of these eight phages carried stx1, stx2, hlyA or eaeA genes.Conclusions:  A cocktail of bacteriophages was capable of lysing most strains of two EHEC serotypes.Significance and Impact of the Study:  This collection of phages can be combined and potentially used as an antimicrobial cocktail to inactivate E. coli strains from O serogroups 157 and 26 and reduce their incidence in the food chain.},

Solid oral dosage forms allowing site-specific gastrointestinal delivery of high doses of phages, e.g., using a pH or enzymatic trigger, would be a game changer for the nascent industry trying to demonstrate the efficacy of phages, including engineered phages for gut microbiome modulation in expensive clinical trials. Spray-drying is a scalable, low-cost process for producing pharmaceutical agents in dry powder form. Encapsulation of a model Salmonella-specific phage (Myoviridae phage Felix O1) was carried out using the process of spray-drying, employing a commercially available Eudragit S100® pH-responsive anionic copolymer composed of methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid formulated with trehalose. Formulation and processing conditions were optimised to improve the survival of phages during spray-drying, and their subsequent protection upon exposure to simulated gastric acidity was demonstrated. Addition of trehalose to the formulation was shown to protect phages from elevated temperatures and desiccation encountered during spray-drying. Direct compression of spray-dried encapsulated phages into tablets was shown to significantly improve phage protection upon exposure to simulated gastric fluid. The results reported here demonstrate the significant potential of spray-dried pH-responsive formulations for oral delivery of bacteriophages targeting gastrointestinal applications.},

  abstract = {Post-birth there is a bacterial assault on all mucosal surfaces. The intestinal microbiome is an important participant in health and disease. The pattern of composition and concentration of the intestinal microbiome varies greatly. Therefore, achieving immunological tolerance in the first 3–4 years of life is critical for maintaining health throughout a lifetime. Probiotic bacteria are organisms that afford beneficial health effects to the host and in certain instances may protect against the development of disease. The potential benefits of modifying the composition of the intestinal microbial cohort for therapeutic benefit is evident in the use in high risks groups such as premature infants, children receiving antibiotics, rotavirus infections in non-vaccinated children and traveler’s diarrhea in adults. Probiotics and prebiotics are postulated to have immunomodulating capabilities by influencing the intestinal microbial cohort and dampening the activity of pathobiont intestinal microbes, such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Clostridia perfringens. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria are examples of probiotics found in the large intestine and so far, the benefits afforded to probiotics have varied in efficacy. Most likely the efficacy of probiotic bacteria has a multifactorial dependency, namely on a number of factors that include agents used, the dose, the pattern of dosing, and the characteristics of the host and the underlying luminal microbial environment and the activity of bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, are small viruses that infect and lyse intestinal bacteria. As such it can be posited that these viruses display an effective local protective control mechanism for the intestinal barrier against commensal pathobionts that indirectly may assist the host in controlling bacterial concentrations in the gut. A co-operative activity may be envisaged between the intestinal epithelia, mucosal immunity and the activity of bacteriophages to eliminate pathobiots, highlighting the potential role of bacteriophages in assisting with maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Hence bacteriophage local control of inflammation and immune responses may be an additional immunological defense mechanism that exploits bacteriophage–mucin glycoprotein interactions that controls bacterial diversity and abundance in the mucin layers of the gut. Moreover, and importantly the efficacy of probiotics may be dependent on the symbiotic incorporation of prebiotics, and the abundance and diversity of the intestinal microbiome encountered. The virome may be an important factor that determines the efficacy of some probiotic formulations.},

  abstract = {Tight junctions (TJs) play a dominant role in gut barrier formation, therefore, resolving the structures of TJs in any animal species is crucial but of major importance in fast growing broilers. They are regulated in molecular composition, ultrastructure and function by intracellular proteins and the cytoskeleton. TJ proteins are classified according to their function into barrier-forming, scaffolding and pore-forming types with deductible consequences for permeability. In spite of their importance for gut health and its integrity limited studies have investigated the TJs in chickens, including the comprehensive evaluation of TJs molecular composition and function in the chicken gut. In the actual study sequence-specific probes to target different TJ genes (claudin 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 19, zonula occludens 1 (ZO1), occludin (OCLN) and tricellulin (MD2)) were designed and probe-based RT-qPCRs were newly developed. Claudin (CLDN) 1, 5, ZO1 and CLDN 3, 7, MD2 were engulfed in multiplex RTqPCRs, minimizing the number of separate reactions and enabling robust testing of many samples. All RT-qPCRs were standardized for chicken jejunum and caecum samples, which enabled specific detection and quantification of the gene expression. Furthermore, the newly established protocols were used to investigate the age developmental changes in the TJs of broiler chickens from 1–35 days of age in the same organ samples. Results revealed a significant increase in mRNA expression between 14 and 21days of age of all tested TJs in jejunum. However, in caecum, mRNA expression of some TJs decreased after 1 day of age whereas some TJs mRNA remained constant till 35 days of age. Taken together, determining the segment-specific changes in the expression of TJ- proteins by RT-qPCR provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning pathophysiological changes in the gut of broiler chickens with various etiologies.},

The tail allows host recognition and delivery of viral DNA from the head shell to the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Here, we present a high-resolution structure of the tail complex of bacteriophage lambda determined by cryoelectron microscopy. Most component proteins of the lambda tail were determined at the atomic scale. The structure sheds light on the molecular organization of the extensively studied tail of bacteriophage lambda.},

Few novel classes of antibiotics have been discovered since 1960, and the pipeline of antibiotics under development is limited. We therefore are heading for a post-antibiotic era in which common infections become untreatable and once again deadly. There is thus an emergent need for both novel classes of antibiotics and novel approaches to treatment, including the repurposing of existing drugs or preclinical compounds and expanded implementation of combination therapies. In this review, we highlight to utilize alternative drug targets/therapies such as combinational therapy, anti-regulator, anti-signal transduction, anti-virulence, anti-toxin, engineered bacteriophages, and microbiome, to defeat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.},

This mechanism does not cause the destruction of commensal bacterial flora. Phages are currently being used with success in humans and animals in targeted therapies for slow-healing infections. They have also found application in the US in eliminating pathogens from the surface of foods of animal and plant origin.

  abstract = {Biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria is a major challenge in the food industry. Once a biofilm is established, such as on food processing equipment, it becomes more difficult to eradicate. Although physical and chemical treatments are often used to control biofilm formation, these treatments can have significant drawbacks. Alternative biofilm treatments are needed. Phage DW-EC was isolated from dawet, an Indonesian traditional Ready-To-Eat food, which has high specificity for Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Phage DW-EC produces several enzymes that can prevent the development of biofilm and biofilm eradication. Depolymerase enzymes break down the polysaccharides layer on the biofilms can lead to biofilm damage. On the other hand, endolysin and putative like-T4 lysozyme will lyse and kill a bacterial cell, thereby preventing biofilm growth. This research aims to determine the capability of previously identified phage DW-EC to inhibit and destroy biofilms produced by several foodborne pathogens. Phage DW-EC formed plaques on the bacterial lawns of EHEC, EPEC, and ETEC. The efficiency of plating (EOP) values for EHEC, EPEC, ETEC, and Bacillus cereus were 1.06, 0.78. 0.70, and 0.00, demonstrating that DW-EC was effective in controlling pathogenic E. coli populations. Furthermore, phage DW-EC showed anti-biofilm activity against foodborne pathogenic bacteria on polystyrene and stainless-steel substrates. DW-EC biofilm inhibition and destruction activities against pathogenic E. coli were significantly higher than against B. cereus biofilms, which was indicated by a lower density of the biofilm than B. cereus. Microscopic visualization verified that bacteriophage DW-EC effectively controlled EHEC, EPEC, and ETEC biofilms. The results showed that DW-EC could inhibit and destroy biofilm, making it promising to be used as an anti-biofilm candidate for polystyrene and stainless steel equipment in the food industry.},

Bacteriophage preparations seem to be an alternative to antibiotics, which can be used at all levels of the food production chain. Their safety and efficacy, however, are of public concern. In this study, a detailed evaluation of BAFASAL® preparation was performed. BAFASAL® is a bacteriophage cocktail that reduces Salmonella in poultry farming. In vivo acute and sub-chronic toxicity studies on rats and tolerance study on targeted animals (chicken broiler) conducted according to GLP and OECD guidelines did not reveal any signs of toxicity, which could be associated with BAFASAL® administration. In addition, no evidences of genotoxicity were observed. The tolerance study with 100-times concentrated dose also did not show any statistically significant differences in the assessed parameters. The in vitro crop assay, mimicking normal feed storage and feed application conditions showed that BAFASAL® reduced the number of Salmonella bacteria in experimentally contaminated feed. Moreover, reductions were observed for all examined forms (liquid, powder, spray). Furthermore, the in vivo efficacy study showed that treatment with BAFASAL® significantly decreased Salmonella content in caeca of birds infected with Salmonella Enteritidis. Detailed examination of BAFASAL® in terms of safety and efficacy, adds to the body of evidence that bacteriophages are harmless to animals and effective in the struggle against bacteria.},

However, despite recent clinical uses of combinations of phages to treat multidrug-resistant infections, a mechanistic understanding of how bacteria evolve resistance against multiple phages is lacking, limiting our ability to deploy phage combinations optimally. Here, we show, using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and pairs of phages targeting shared or distinct surface receptors, that the timing and order of phage exposure determine the strength, cost, and mutational basis of resistance. Whereas sequential exposure allowed bacteria to acquire multiple resistance mutations effective against both phages, this evolutionary trajectory was prevented by simultaneous exposure, resulting in quantitatively weaker resistance. The order of phage exposure determined the fitness costs of sequential resistance, such that certain sequential orders imposed much higher fitness costs than the same phage pair in the reverse order. Together, these data suggest that phage combinations can be optimized to limit the strength of evolved resistances while maximizing their associated fitness costs to promote the long-term efficacy of phage therapy.},

  abstract = {This study explores the role of IgA-coated bacteria in improving feed efficiency in chickens, offering a novel perspective for probiotic screening. Chickens with high feed efficiency were found to have a greater abundance of Gram-positive bacteria, while low feed efficiency chickens exhibited higher levels of Gram-negative bacteria and potential pathogens. Through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and integrating analysis of cecal and IgA-coated microbiota, we precisely identified Blautia as a key genus linked to improved feed efficiency. Further validation demonstrated that Blautia coccoides, a representative species of this genus, enhances feed efficiency and activates B cells to produce Immunoglobulin A (IgA), both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings provide new insights into the potential of IgA-coated bacteria as functional probiotics, offering a promising strategy for enhancing feed efficiency in animal production.},

However, the overuse of antibiotics has increased rates of drug resistance among E. faecalis isolates. Bacteriophages and their derivatives have recently been identified as good candidates for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections. Here, we isolated a virulent E. faecalis phage, PHB08, using the double-layer plate method. The bioactivity of the phage was determined via one-step growth curve testing and bacterial killing assays, and whole-genome sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq platform. In addition, protein expression and antibiofilm assays were performed to investigate the activity of the phage lysin. Results showed that PHB08 has a 55,244-bp linear double-stranded DNA genome encoding 91 putative coding sequences. PHB08 inhibited the growth of host strain EF3964 at 37 °C in tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium, while in vegetable models, PHB08 caused a 4.69-log decrease in viable E. faecalis cells after 24 h. Both PHB08 and its endolysin lys08 showed antibiofilm activity against E. faecalis biofilms, which was enhanced by Mn2+ ions. Thus, virulent phage PHB08 and endolysin lys08 may be good candidates for reducing and/or eradicating E. faecalis infections.},

  abstract = {Objective This research aimed to study the effects of Artemisia argyi flavonoids (AAF) supplemented in diets on the growth performance and immune function of broiler chickens challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods A total of one hundred and ninety-two 1-d-old broiler chicks were assigned into 4 treatment groups, which were, respectively, fed a basal diet (control), fed a diet with 750 mg/kg AAF, fed a basal diet, and challenged with LPS, fed a diet with 750 mg/kg AAF, and challenged with LPS. Each treatment had six pens with 8 chicks per pen. On days 14, 16, 18, 20 (stress phase I) and 28, 30, 32, 34 (stress phase II), broilers were injected with LPS (500 μg/kg body weight) or an equivalent amount of saline. Results The results demonstrated that dietary AAF significantly improved the body weight (d 21) and alleviated the decrease of average daily gain in broilers challenged with LPS on d 21 and d 35 (p{$<$}0.05). Dietary AAF increased bursa fabricius index, and dramatically attenuated the elevation of spleen index caused by LPS on d 35 (p{$<$}0.05). Furthermore, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration decreased with AAF supplementation on d 21 (p{$<$}0.05). Diet treatment and LPS challenge exhibited a significant interaction for the concentration of IL-1β (d 21) and IL-6 (d 35) in serum (p{$<$}0.05). Additionally, AAF supplementation mitigated the increase of IL-1β, IL-6 in liver and spleen induced by LPS on d 21 and 35 (p{$<$}0.05). This study also showed that AAF supplementation significantly reduced the expression of IL-1β (d 21) and nuclear transcription factor kappa-B p65 (d 21 and 35) in liver (p{$<$}0.05), and dietary AAF and LPS treatment exhibited significant interaction for the gene expression of IL-6 (d 21), toll like receptor 4 (d 35) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (d 35) in spleen (p{$<$}0.05). Conclusion In conclusion, AAF could be used as a potential natural immunomodulator to improve growth performance and alleviate immune stress in broilers challenged with LPS.},

  abstract = {Intestinal flora regulation is an effective method to intervene and treat diseases associated with microbiome imbalance. In addition to conventional probiotic supplement, phage delivery has recently exhibited great prospect in modifying gut flora composition and regulating certain gene expression of gut bacteria. However, the protein structure of phage is vulnerable to external factors during storage and delivery, which leads to the loss of infection ability and flora regulation function. Encapsulation strategy provides an effective solution for improving phage stability and precisely controlling delivery dosage. Different functional materials including enzyme-responsive and pH-responsive polymers have been used to construct encapsulation carriers to protect phages from harsh conditions and release them in the colon. Meanwhile, diverse carriers showed different characteristics in structure and function, which influenced their protective effect and delivery efficiency. This review systematically summarizes recent research progress on the phage encapsulation and delivery, with an emphasis on function properties of carrier systems in the protection effect and colon-targeted delivery. The present review may provide a theoretical reference for the encapsulation and delivery of phage as microbiota modulator, so as to expedite the development of functional material and delivery carrier, as well as the advances in practical application of intestinal flora regulation.},

However, the crisis of antimicrobial resistance today led to its revival in many countries. While many articles dive into its clinical application now, little research is presenting phage therapy from a regulatory perspective. Here, we focus on the regulations of phage therapy by dividing sections into Eastern Europe where it was never abandoned and Western Europe, Australia, the United States, India, and China where it only re-attracted researchers’ attention in recent decades. New insights about its regulations in China are provided as little English literature has specifically discussed this previously. Ultimately, by introducing the regulations in phage therapy for human health across representative countries, we hope to provide ideas of how countries may borrow each other’s adapting legislation in phage therapy to best overcome the current regulatory hurdles.},

  abstract = {The potential health benefits of probiotics may not be realized because of the substantial reduction in their viability during food storage and gastrointestinal transit. Microencapsulation can be used to enhance the resistance of probiotics to unfavorable conditions. A range of oral delivery systems has been developed to increase the level of probiotics reaching the colon including embedding and coating systems. This review introduces emerging strategies for the microencapsulation of probiotics and highlights the key mechanisms of their stress–tolerance properties. Recent in vitro and in vivo models for evaluation of the efficiency of probiotic delivery systems are also reviewed. Encapsulation technologies are required to maintain the viability of probiotics during storage and within the human gut so as to increase their ability to colonize the colon. These technologies work by protecting the probiotics from harsh environmental conditions, as well as increasing their mucoadhesive properties. Typically, the probiotics are either embedded inside or coated with food-grade materials such as biopolymers or lipids. In some cases, additional components may be coencapsulated to enhance their viability such as nutrients or protective agents. The importance of having suitable in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate the efficiency of probiotic delivery systems is also emphasized.},

We also evaluated whether occurring antiphage antibodies had neutralizing properties toward applied phages (K rate). Among 20 examined patients receiving the MS-1 phage cocktail orally and/or locally, the majority did not show a noticeably higher level of antiphage antibodies in their sera during phage administration. Even in those individual cases with an increased immune response, mostly by induction of IgG and IgM, the presence of antiphage antibodies did not translate into unsatisfactory clinical results of phage therapy. On the other hand, a negative outcome of the treatment occurred in some patients who showed relatively weak production of antiphage antibodies before and during treatment. This may imply that possible induction of antiphage antibodies is not an obstacle to the implementation of phage therapy and support our assumption that the outcome of the phage treatment does not primarily depend on the appearance of antiphage antibodies in sera of patients during therapy. These conclusions are in line with our previous findings. The confirmation of this thesis is of great interest as regards the efficacy of phage therapy in humans.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Bacteriophage-encoded endolysins degrading the bacterial peptidoglycan are promising antibacterials for combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, endolysins have limited use against Gram-negative bacteria, since the outer membrane prevents access to the peptidoglycan. Here, we present Innolysins, an innovative concept for engineering endolysins to exert antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Innolysins combine the enzymatic activity of endolysins with the binding capacity of phage receptor binding proteins (RBPs). As proof-of-concept, we constructed 12 Innolysins by fusing phage T5 endolysin and RBP Pb5 in different configurations. One of these, Innolysin Ec6 displayed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli only in the presence of Pb5 receptor FhuA, leading to 1.22\,±\,0.12 log reduction~in~cell counts. Accordingly, other bacterial species carrying FhuA homologs such as Shigella sonnei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Innolysin Ec6. To enhance the antibacterial activity, we further constructed 228 novel Innolysins by fusing 23 endolysins with Pb5. High-throughput screening allowed to select Innolysin Ec21 as the best antibacterial candidate, leading to 2.20\,±\,0.09 log reduction in E. coli~counts.~Interestingly, Innolysin Ec21 also displayed bactericidal activity against E. coli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, reaching a 3.31\,±\,0.53 log reduction in cell counts. Overall, the Innolysin approach expands previous endolysin-engineering strategies, allowing customization of endolysins by exploiting phage RBPs to specifically target Gram-negative bacteria.},

  abstract = {The emergence of multidrug-resistant infections and antibiotic failures have raised concerns over human and veterinary medicine worldwide. Poultry production has had to confront the problems of an alarming increase in bacterial resistance, including zoonotic pathogens. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis have been the most frequently reported human foodborne diseases linked to poultry. This situation has strongly stimulated a renewal of scientists’ interest in bacteriophages (phages) since the beginning of the 21st century. Bacteriophages are the viruses of bacteria. They are abundant in nature, and accompany bacteria in each environment they colonize, including human microbiota. In this review, we focused on the use of bacteriophages as therapeutic agents to treat infections and reduce counts of pathogenic bacteria in poultry, as biocontrol agents to eliminate foodborne pathogens on/in food, and also as disinfectants to reduce contamination on food-contact surfaces or poultry carcasses in industrial conditions. Most of the phage-based products are targeted against the main foodborne pathogens, such as Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens. Phages are currently addressed at all stages of the poultry production "from farm to fork", however, their implementation into live birds and food products still provokes discussions especially in the context of the current legal framework, limitations, as well as public health and safety.},

  abstract = {In the face of the increasingly severe problem of antibiotic resistance, phage therapy is regarded as a highly potential alternative. Compared with traditional antimicrobial agents, a key research area of phage therapy is the study of phage-resistant mutant bacteria. To effectively monitor and prevent this resistance, it is crucial to conduct in-depth exploration of the mechanism behind phage resistance. In this study, a strain of Salmonella enteritidis (sm140) and the corresponding phage (Psm140) were isolated from chicken liver and sewage, respectively. Using the double-layer plate method, successfully screened out phage-resistant mutant strains. Whole-genome resequencing of 3 resistant strains found that the wbaP gene of all 3 strains had mutations at a specific position (1118), with the base changing from G to A. This mutation causes the gene-encoded glycine to be replaced by aspartic acid. Subsequent studies found that the frequency of this gene mutation is extremely high, reaching 84\%, and all mutations occur at the same position. To further explore the relationship between the wbaP gene and phage resistance, knockout strains and complement strains of the wbaP gene were constructed. The experimental results confirmed the association between the wbaP gene and phage resistance. At the same time, biological characteristics and virulence were evaluated for wild strains, resistant strains, knockout strains, and complement strains. It was found that mutations or deletions of the wbaP gene lead to a decrease in bacterial environmental adaptability and virulence. Through systematic research on the mechanism and biological characteristics of phage resistance, this study provides important references and guidance for the development of new phage therapies, promoting progress in the field of antimicrobial treatment. At the same time, the emergence of phage resistance due to wbaP gene mutations is reported for the first time in salmonella, providing a new perspective and ideas for further studying phage resistance mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Salmonella is a primary enteric pathogen related to the contamination of poultry and other food products in numerous foodborne outbreaks. The continuous emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has become a serious issue due to the overuse of antibiotics. Hence, lytic phages are considered alternative biocontrol agents against these bacterial superbugs. Here, two Salmonella phages-S4lw and D5lw-were subjected to genomic and biological characterization and further encapsulated to improve the stability under acidic conditions mimicking gastrointestinal conditions. The two lytic phages, S4lw and D5lw, taxonomically belong to new species under the Guernseyvirinae and Ackermannviridae families, respectively. Each phage showed antimicrobial activities against diverse Salmonella spp., such as S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, achieving 1.7-3.4 log reduction after 2-6~h of treatment. The phage cocktail at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 or 1000 completely inhibited these Salmonella strains for at least 14~h at 25~°C. Additionally, the bead-encapsulated phage cocktail could withstand low pH and different simulated gut environments for at least 1~h. Overall, the newly isolated phages can potentially mitigate Salmonella spp. under the gastrointestinal environments through encapsulation and may be further applied via oral administration to resolve common antimicrobial resistance issues in the poultry production chain.},

  abstract = {Arsenic, a naturally occurring heavy metal pollutant, is one of the functioning risk factors for neurological toxicity in humans. However, little is known about the effects of arsenic on the nervous system of Gallus Gallus. To investigate whether arsenic induce neurotoxicity and influence the oxidative stress and heat shock proteins (Hsps) response in chickens, seventy-two 1-day-old male Hy-line chickens were treated with different doses of arsenic trioxide (As2O3). The histological changes, antioxidant enzyme activity, and the expressions of Hsps were detected. Results showed slightly histology changes were obvious in the brain tissues exposure to arsenic. The activities of Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) were decreased compared to the control, whereas the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was increased gradually along with increase in diet-arsenic. The mRNA levels of Hsps and protein expressions of Hsp60 and Hsp70 were up-regulated. These results suggested that sub-chronic exposure to arsenic induced neurotoxicity in chickens. Arsenic exposure disturbed the balance of oxidants and antioxidants. Increased heat shock response tried to protect chicken brain tissues from tissues damage caused by oxidative stress. The mechanisms of neurotoxicity induced by arsenic include oxidative stress and heat shock protein response in chicken brain tissues.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, which are viruses infecting bacteria, are the most ubiquitous and diverse entities in the biosphere. There is accumulating evidence revealing their important roles in shaping the structure of various microbiomes. Thanks to (viral) metagenomic sequencing, a large number of new bacteriophages have been discovered. However, lacking a standard and automatic virus classification pipeline, the taxonomic characterization of new viruses seriously lag behind the sequencing efforts. In particular, according to the latest version of ICTV, several large phage families in the previous classification system are removed. Therefore, a comprehensive review and comparison of taxonomic classification tools under the new standard are needed to establish the state-of-the-art. In this work, we retrained and tested four recently published tools on newly labeled databases. We demonstrated their utilities and tested them on multiple datasets, including the RefSeq, short contigs, simulated metagenomic datasets, and low-similarity datasets. This study provides a comprehensive review of phage family classification in different scenarios and a practical guidance for choosing appropriate taxonomic classification pipelines. To our best knowledge, this is the first review conducted under the new ICTV classification framework. The results show that the new family classification framework overall leads to better conserved groups and thus makes family-level classification more feasible.},

  abstract = {A major public health impact is associated with foodborne illnesses around the globe. Additionally, bacteria are becoming more resistant to antibiotics, which pose a global threat. Currently, many scientific efforts have been made to develop and implement new technologies to combat bacteria considering the increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in using phages as biocontrol agents for foodborne pathogens in animals used for food production and in food products themselves. Foodborne outbreaks persist, globally, in many foods, some of which lack adequate methods to control any pathogenic contamination (like fresh produce). This interest may be attributed both to consumers’ desire for more natural food and to the fact that foodborne outbreaks continue to occur in many foods. Poultry is the most common animal to be treated with phage therapy to control foodborne pathogens. A large number of foodborne illnesses worldwide are caused by Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter, which are found in poultry and egg products. Conventional bacteriophage-based therapy can prevent and control humans and animals from various infectious diseases. In this context, describing bacteriophage therapy based on bacterial cells may offer a breakthrough for treating bacterial infections. Large-scale production of pheasants may be economically challenging to meet the needs of the poultry market. It is also possible to produce bacteriophage therapy on a large scale at a reduced cost. Recently, they have provided an ideal platform for designing and producing immune-inducing phages. Emerging foodborne pathogens will likely be targeted by new phage products in the future. In this review article, we will mainly focus on the Bacteriophages (phages) that have been proposed as an alternative strategy to antibiotics for food animal pathogens and their use for public health and food safety.},
